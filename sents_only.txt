Welcome back to our show !
OK .
This is Maria ,
and I do n't know your last name .
Polk .
Oh that 's good .
From Polkton , Maria Polk .
OK .
And where did you grow up ?
Were you born in this area here ?
I was born in Cottonville . Right outside of Norwood in Stanley County .
Oh , OK .
When you were little , did your mom read you books ,
or did somebody read you books in your house ?
My mama read to me and my sister .
Uh-huh .
What kind of books were your favorites ?
Do you remember any that were maybe a real favorite of yours ?
Mm , I kind of liked them all .
Um , I did n't really have a favorite .
No ?
Any particular types , like ones with pictures or . /- 
Can you think of a story that they told you that you liked for them to read over and over ? 
Um , I think my favorite was like , " Little Red Riding Hood ; "
I loved that book .
" Little Red Riding Hood " ?
So when you read to yourself did you read different stories than the ones they would read to you ?
Mmm , basically , something different .
Did you get to go to the library when you were little ?
Uh-huh , all the time .
Yeah .
So , you would check books out ?
Uh-huh .
Mostly , I liked to spend time reading encyclopedias -- <TURN> Oh , really ?<TURN> -- when I was little .
You like to read encyclopedias .
In your family , do you remember if there was any storyteller ?
Well , my uncle was always telling stories
and , uh , we had this house across the street from where I grew up that was old
and he never finished it .
He started it
and he told stories that , um , um , men being in it that house at night and stuff and for us not to go outside at night .
Would he scare you ?
Yeah .
So <disfluency> we </disfluency> , at a certain time , we were scared to go over there because we 'd always go outside and look at the house across the street .
Um , did he tell stories to big groups of people , or just one - on - one ?
Just to our cousins and all of us that hung around each other all the time .
Uh-huh .
Now , do you have kids at your house ?
No .
<disfluency> Only </disfluency> , only on Sunday : my niece and nephew and my cousins .
Uh-huh .
Do you like to read to them ?
Do they bring their books over ?
I read to my niece .
She likes the pop-out _ _ books .
Uh-huh .
How old is she ?
She 's , ah six .
She likes the pictures that pop out at you .
She likes for me to read them to her .
Can she read to herself yet ?
Not yet ,
but she tries to .
Mostly , she just looks at the pictures .
<disfluency> Is she </disfluency> , what grade is she in ?
Do you know ?
She 's in kindergarten .
She 's in kindergarten ?
OK .
That 's pretty much all I need to know , about how you liked reading and things when you were little .
Is there anything else you 'd like to say about this , that comes to your mind ?
have you ever got one of those calls that 's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they 're either offering a service or they 're introducing some new product in the area
and normally when they call you 're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
yes yes
that is that one that you were talking about
that was the big one I 'm talking about
I work weird hours
and invariably just about the time I 'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
uh-huh uh-huh
and you 're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone
you either hear the click as soon as you say hello
you hear the click of the recording coming on
um-hum _ _
or you hear somebody already starting <disfluency> reading </disfluency> reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already
that 's true
or the ones that <disfluency> are </disfluency> are generated by a computer
it 's just a computer voice that comes on the line
those are the ones that I really really hate too
even had some of them
<disfluency> the </disfluency> they 're voice activated
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah sometimes <disfluency> I </disfluency> I get them on my uh answering machine at home
so -/ 
and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages and I go through them and most of them are n't from anybody at all
what I would love to see done to stop all of this -/ 
uh-huh 
we 've got a thing in this country
you can have your phone number unlisted
um-hum _ _
I think a law should be passed to where any of these people -/ 
I think it 's great <disfluency> that </disfluency> you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if they 're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
um-hum _ _
yeah
see I have an unlisted telephone number
but I still get all of those calls
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand
so yeah I do
I really feel that that 's uh an invasion of my privacy
I agree with you on that particular subject there
let me see
that 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
I put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door _ _ _ _ either religious groups or people -- <TURN> um-hum _ _<TURN> -- peddling products
if I wanted their products I would 've either gone to the store to bought it
or I would 've called for their <disfluency> salesman </disfluency> salesman to come out
um-hum _ _ um-hum _ _
yeah that 's true
living in an apartment complex though you know <disfluency> you ca n't </disfluency> um you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around
so usually what I do is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there 's people coming around you know
and they 're trying to sell something
<disfluency> or </disfluency> or they 're from a religious organization
and I really hate that
I really really do
I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
and um gosh it was about nine o 'clock at night too
it was n't even what I would consider you know a family hour
it 's time to you know start going to bed
<disfluency> and </disfluency> uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
and uh I 've read a lot about uh that particular sect
and I do n't particularly care for it
so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
now I agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in <disfluency> that </disfluency> whatever manner they want to
but I think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
um-hum _ _
I 'm on my turf
if I want them there I 'll call for them
otherwise I do n't want to know they exist
right
yeah yeah
no <disfluency> I </disfluency> I agree with you there though
I mean they want to choose that particular religion then that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and I do n't like the way that they do it either
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and it 's their mission <disfluency> as they do </disfluency> as they go door-to-door _ _ _ _
and they go out into the public
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and I do n't know
<disfluency> I just </disfluency> um I just do n't particularly care for that at all
and <disfluency> that </disfluency> that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting <disfluency> to </disfluency> uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because I have my own
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting I 've even gone so far as to put that
I 've got a storm door on the front of the house
and I 've put in -/ 
I do n't know how much clearer it can be
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting
I should have guessed
I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise because I still get -/ 
yeah yeah that 's true yeah
no <disfluency> I do n't </disfluency> uh <disfluency> I do n't have </disfluency> I did n't go that far
but uh yeah I probably could do the same thing uh you know
I do n't have a storm door
but I 'm sure I could rig up something
but you know I do n't think that that would stop people
I mean it 's like <disfluency> they </disfluency> they see that word and it says uh go instead of stop
oh goodness
wonder if there 'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do -/ 
well that would be technically illegal
it 'd be harassment
oh gosh
but I consider invasion of my privacy -- <TURN> yeah yeah<TURN> -- a harassment in itself
yeah yeah yeah that 's true
that 's true
hm well what else
I believe we 've pretty much summed everything up
I know
but I remember <disfluency> you </disfluency> you talked about something
you started off
and you said -/ 
well let me think
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door
you said something else
and I ca n't remember what it was
and I thought yeah <disfluency> that </disfluency> that kind of touched a nerve right there
but <disfluency> we got </disfluency> uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
I 'm drawing the blank
oh goodness
okay is our five minutes up
uh pretty close to it
well I 've enjoyed talking with you
pretty close
well it was nice talking to you too Jim
and take it easy now
good night
okay
thanks
bye
I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings .
And one particular movie theater we went to , they would show serials every Saturday , which were a continued story .
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode , and you , um , would n't know what had taken place .
So we would go every Saturday morning .
And also at this theater , they gave prizes to different people .
And one of the way they gave prizes was , they would take big group photos and everybody , /- 
and there were stairs going up to a balcony , real wide stairs .
And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs
and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture .
And they 'd take the picture
and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed
and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture
and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes .
Is that for real ?
That 's for real !
That really happened !
And one time I can remember , I think it was Steve , my brother , um ,
he , /- 
and they would give treats like candy ,
I do n't even remember what all kinds of prizes they would give .
But for some reason , and I think this is really true , he got ice cream sandwiches !
Like a box of ice cream sandwiches .
And of course there 's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you 're at a 2 - hour movie !
They 're going to melt !
And another , um , /- 
<disfluency> that was in , </disfluency> that was in High Point , NC.
And then we moved to Charlotte
and we used to go to -- and I do n't think it 's even still there I do n't know if the building is or not -- but the Dilworth Theatre .
I lived in the Dilworth area ,
and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre
and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in .
And we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , could go to the movie .
We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie ,
and I sound like I 'm 95 years old -- with those kinds of prices .
Um , but we would go to the movie
and then you would go in and get <disfluency> your </disfluency> , your snack that you wanted .
And there were several different choices .
I do n't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life .
But we would , uh , buy , /- 
lollipops is what they call them now ,
but we called them suckers
and we would get often a 2 - cent sucker .
Are you making fun ?
No , I love this story .
And the 2 - cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop .
And we called them 2 - cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny .
Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle .
And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel
and we called that an all day sucker , just because you could n't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long .
And one other form of refreshment that we got , which really embarrassed my mother because she did n't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday , /- 
there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre .
And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this ;
all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this .
We would go into the bakery
and we would ask for -- a nickel worth of scraps !
And we did n't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie .
And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking , mistakes .
So they would fill little bags for us
and we would give them a nickel
and we could take that to the movie theatre with us .
And that 's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now .
I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre .
And when I was young , it was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie .
I mean , my mother knew where we were going
and she knew when we would get back ,
but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ;
you just would n't do it .
And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie
and we would do that . Which is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore
and it 's not just because <disfluency> things are </disfluency> , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic .
You have to check everything about a movie , check it out to see what the content is
and just was n't like that when I was growing up .
Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which seems to be what I remember most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey ,
and she was a next door neighbor also ,
and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35
and she passed away with cancer .
But <disfluency> we </disfluency> , we remained close friends .
In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment either one of us ever had .
And when we were , um , little girls we used to play " Career Girls " !
We did !
And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen .
And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together
and then when we grew up , we sure did ;
we got an apartment .
Uh-huh .
Um , Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups
and <disfluency> it just </disfluency> , <disfluency> it seems like </disfluency> , I remember we both had like our mother 's long skirts ,
or the skirts would be long on us
and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers .
But <disfluency> we had </disfluency> , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother 's
and I did n't have the necklace .
And it was really beautiful
and I really , really wanted one .
So we only had the one necklace
and <disfluency> we </disfluency> , er , we decided , /- 
I do n't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice or whatever ,
but she said I could wear it part of the time .
And we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever .
And the way we decided who got to wear it first , /- 
and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally ,
she said the youngest one got to wear it first
and she was like six months younger than I am .
So , <disfluency> it </disfluency> , that became a normal thing with us .
Whenever we only had one of something she would always say , " Well , I think the youngest one gets to do it , or wear it or whatever first . "
And , that just always stuck in my mind , that <disfluency> in </disfluency> , in our adult life I brought that up to her
and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that
and I thought to myself , " she does , "
and then she laughed about it
and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one .
Um , also we did a lot of pretending
and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups .
And my sister and I used to pretend also
and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am , maybe two and a half ,
and we used to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion ,
we had a Saretha ,
I do n't know where in the world that name came from .
But we would switch playing Robin Hood ,
one would play Robin Hood
and one would play Saretha .
And Saretha was the counter ,
would be the same thing as Maid Marion ,
and , <disfluency> why </disfluency> , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion .
But in my mind I can remember playing that , like all day long .
And we would go over to my grandparents '
and they had <disfluency> a </disfluency> a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch .
And it was just a great place to pretend
and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters
and we could make those our horses
or , uh , it could be a castle ;
just do many things with it .
Um , and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge , /- 
I do n't know ,
I guess it was an oak tree ,
but it was a really big tree ,
but it was a climbable tree .
And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side
and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches .
And that was another game that Jill and I used to play ;
we would pretend we were in the jungle
and we would climb up on the tree
and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant .
And in the yard , we had an old tree that had been cut down
and just the stump was remaining
and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump
and we would use that stump <disfluency> as a </disfluency> , as a throne
and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her
and that would be the throne
and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever .
When I was a teenager , an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark .
And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old ;
we were of driving age .
And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with
and <disfluency> there were </disfluency> , golly , there might 've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends .
Everybody had their own " best " friend
but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together .
Um , and we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , had that many girls
but we would only go out in a couple of cars
and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle ,
her dad had a VW Beetle ,
and we 'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle .
Did Betty Belle turn Catholic ?
No , huh-uh .
She did n't ?
No .
So we went out one night to the movie ,
but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza
and then we went to , 
and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen ,
and we did n't have chain pizza places like we do now , like Pizza Hut and all that .
This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go .
And we went to Open Kitchen
and we would have eight or 10 girls
and we would order one pizza and all share it
and everyone would only get one piece
and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money to leave tips .
We would also drink water .
So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses ,
but we had fun
and we did n't even think about it .
We just did what we could get away with .
Anyway , that night we were gon na go see Wait Until Dark
and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre ,
and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going <disfluency> somewhere </disfluency> to the same place it 's <disfluency> kind of a </disfluency> , pretty much of a spectacle ;
we 're all in this long line
and we 're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time .
So we bought our tickets
and we went into the Manor Theatre
and we found a row of seats
and we <disfluency> sat </disfluency> , <disfluency> file </disfluency> , all filed in .
<disfluency> And I just remember seeing </disfluency> , and I was sitting in a middle section ,
I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me .
And I just remember that movie <disfluency> was </disfluency> , had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful
and it 's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and , what is it ? Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is , where they 're actual horror movies .
This was , uh , a real intense , um , drama and , just very scary ;
kept you on the edge of your seat .
And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us , and it was n't just our group , but so many people in the theatre , they screamed out at one time .
And that 's really all I remember about that night ,
it was just a lot of fun .
uh how do you feel about gun control
uh on the scale they gave one to ten I 'd say I 'm probably a four
<disfluency> I 'm not totally </disfluency> I 'm not one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns
but I do n't think we should be carrying Uzis either
you know what I mean
yeah I know
I mean I do n't think /- 
machine guns automatic weapons I do n't believe in things like that
but I think -- <TURN> some people do I know<TURN> -- that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose
<disfluency> and </disfluency> but I think there should be some restrictions when you buy one you know
they should do more background search on you
they should
I think it should be harder to buy one 
right
yeah there 's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they do n't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores
yeah
no they do n't
they do n't ask anything except how old you are I do n't think
that 's kind of scary
I 'm from California
<disfluency> my mom </disfluency> the last time I <disfluency> was </disfluency> like purchased a gun <disfluency> my </disfluency> my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one
and -- <TURN> uh-huh<TURN> -- <disfluency> they </disfluency> he had to fill out some forms
but I guess California might be tougher
I do n't know
yeah they might be
or you know how we are here in Texas
it 's like everybody 's a hunter so /- 
I 'm not much of a hunter
but -- <TURN> yeah<TURN> -- it 's /- 
I 've never even bought a gun myself
my dad 's given it to me
or someone 's given me one
so I 'm probably real illegal you know carrying guns that are n't even mine
yeah <disfluency> it 's a </disfluency> it 's a hard decision to make
it really is
uh the only problem I have with gun control is that <disfluency> they </disfluency> the radicals wan na ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gon na <disfluency> be </disfluency> be the people who are gon na kill you anyway
like the bumper sticker
it 's true yeah
yeah exactly right
it really is because they 're gon na get them one way or another
they will always have a way
look at drugs
they always have a way to get that so /- 
right
right
right
and they 're illegal
so I do n't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together 
no <disfluency> I </disfluency> yeah <disfluency> I I I I </disfluency> I agree that it would be like <disfluency> people in </disfluency> people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gon na get them
and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something
right
that 's true
I think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them
yeah I <disfluency> have have </disfluency> <disfluency> gun gun </disfluency> <disfluency> have </disfluency> have gun management 101
right yeah exactly
you can not take the gun home until you 've taken this course
sign up here
something like that
yeah
or <disfluency> required required </disfluency> required for every college student oh
right
exactly
before graduation
God gun control
<disfluency> it 's </disfluency> it 's such a heated topic in <disfluency> the </disfluency> the /- 
and people get so emotional about it 
yep
oh yeah they do
they get real emotional about it all the /- 
I 've worked with a lot of people that hunt 
and <disfluency> they just </disfluency> <disfluency> they </disfluency> they do n't see any sense in it at all
they think it 's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control
but then of course they 're hunters
they know what they 're doing
they do n't realize there 're a bunch of crazy people out there that /- 
some of them are crazy too
whew yeah yeah
they go out there and get drunk and start shooting
do n't use it for that
well yeah that 's true
they shoot each other thinking they 're a deer
yeah
darn I thought you were a deer Bob
sorry my mistake
yeah Marge I do n't know what happened to your husband
he just never came back
looked like antlers
I do n't know
yep that happens a lot too
yeah
oh
but I guess that 's it
that 's my opinion on it
so what now
I 'm not sure
uh uh I think we just hang up
yeah okay
thanks bye
<disfluency> I </disfluency> let 's see
yeah yeah we just say good-bye _ _ and hang up
okay okay okay
thanks
bye-bye _ _
here goes Sharon
okay
well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars
that 's the only thing I found out tonight
oh you found that out tonight
I had n't even heard that
that 's great
I think he deserves every penny of it
yeah yeah
but there are some others out there that I do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting
well is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would
oh yeah
wonder because football -/ 
and <disfluency> they play a lot </disfluency> they play a lot longer season too
and a lot more games right
yep that 's exactly right
uh-huh
but I think -/ 
let 's see
the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California
I do n't even know who won the pennant last year
beats me
I mean I know Yankees have won a lot of games through the years
yeah
not lately though
we have been talking about this
I tried to call earlier
uh-huh
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from
then I started cleaning
and I do n't know where I even put that paper
<disfluency> I </disfluency> yeah I was just cleaning and throwing -/ 
threw it away
oh gosh let 's see
the teams that I think -/ 
the A's were in it last year the Oakland A's
and I think it was -/ 
I do n't think it was an all California baseball
well have you ever played baseball
I play softball
well that 's what I did when I was growing up
yeah
that was fun
yeah that 's fun
that 's a whole different sport
uh-huh
yeah
let 's see
but <disfluency> I think </disfluency> I think the Rangers need to go
and I think the Pirates will go
and uh let 's see
Rangers have got a new guy this year
I do n't remember his name either
do you ever go see the Rangers
every once in a while
<disfluency> I </disfluency> I like to go on the nights when there 's <disfluency> not anybody out there </disfluency> not very many people out there
it 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd
yeah I think it 's fun
I like just looking at the billboards
yeah
but sometimes <disfluency> when I </disfluency> if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
yeah it 's nice at night
yeah
that 's when I 've been
it is
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and do you know anything about that new stadium
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there
well no
yeah <disfluency> that </disfluency> <disfluency> that huge </disfluency> it 's suppose to be a huge stadium
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it
and uh they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there
and you 're going to be able to buy your -/ 
what was -/ 
no wait
of course
what was it about the liquor
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> that 's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play
was that -/ 
oh yeah
see you just -/ 
and they 're never going to let liquor in there
well they 're trying
I know
but they try every year
and every year they get thrown out
it 's so stupid because they let you take it in there
but <disfluency> they do n't </disfluency> they <disfluency> do n't allow you to sell it </disfluency> do n't allow them to sell it there
uh-huh
but uh that new stadium 's going to be real nice
and I heard <disfluency> that there 's </disfluency> uh that you can bid on that stadium
last night on the news I heard they said <disfluency> you could </disfluency> you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
kind of right
<disfluency> it 's going to </disfluency> it 's going to go to the highest bidder
oh
well that 's the way to do it
so -/ 
yeah
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame
you hear that
that 's my kids turning on their music
let me see
Holly turn it down
oh
I think it 's the Bartman the Simpsons
oh God I stay away from them
I wish I could
I bet you do
and you get tired of that
yeah
that 's typical bureaucracy though
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> <disfluency> that 's </disfluency> I think it 's going to be any where you go
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones
I do n't know
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad
yeah
well but they ca n't be though
they do n't have as much money
yeah
but <disfluency> the politics </disfluency> the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
most the time
oh man
but in Dallas you do n't even know who 's <disfluency> in </disfluency> in administration
there 's so many of them
you do n't even know who to pay off huh
I mean somebody walks in the classroom
and you do n't know what they 're there for you know when they 're coming how long they 're going to be
yeah
oh how funny
you know it 's just them
there they are
and they 're writing the whole time
no communication whatsoever
no
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything
and I finally got to where I go okay I 'm Debbie Moore you know may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know because you know you never know where they 're going what they 'll report or -/ 
yeah
I know
and they 'll tell you they 've written something down
and you -- <TURN> <disfluency> and you have n't </disfluency> <disfluency> you </disfluency> and you never see it<TURN> -- hope they 're telling you
no huh-uh
that 's got to be frustrating
oh it is
how long have you <disfluency> taught </disfluency> taught Dallas schools
uh this is my eleventh year
ooh that 's about uh ten too many
no actually it 's -/ 
now my job 's good much better than a lot -/ 
yeah
uh-huh
because I 'm Chapter One and all I do is teach reading all day long
yeah
oh
and it 's just ten children at a time
well that 's not bad
no it 's good
and you 've got a lot of federal money too
but has n't it changed a lot over the years
teaching
oh yes
yeah
or working in the system
yes
when I first started teaching I remember I went up to my job and I said okay I want to see a curriculum guide you know so I 'll know what I 'm suppose to teach
and they go we do n't have one of -/ 
we do n't even know where one is
oh God
and I go okay
I mean <disfluency> you just </disfluency> you did what you wanted to do
oh how funny

yeah I guess
so -/ 
yeah being told what to do is worse
um-hum _ _
so how long are we suppose to talk for
well you can talk for ten minutes
but you do n't have to
oh you can
yeah and no
if you talk to ten then they come <disfluency> over </disfluency> on and say oh you 've extended your limit and please say good-bye _ _ within the next five seconds
oh I have n't ever talked that long
well you know I had n't either till last night I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio
we started talking about gangs you know

so hers was the first one I <disfluency> got </disfluency> gotten 
and uh -/ 
oh she was telling me all her problems
and it went over ten minutes
<disfluency> did she </disfluency> <disfluency> did she </disfluency> did you all not talk about the topic at all
well yeah we did
but the topic was boring I thought
what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party
oh
oh gosh
what was -/ 
I 'm trying to remember
oh <disfluency> the other </disfluency> the one I talked about the other night was good
it was um about movies you know <disfluency> who </disfluency> what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
oh yeah
I could go on and on about that
me too because we go all the time
the guy I was talking to never goes
he was boy it sounds like you 're really up on this
and I said I see at least two a week
so -- <TURN> ooh neat<TURN> -- that was real good to talk about that
have you seen like uh Silence Of The Lambs
no
you 've got to go see that
the last one I saw was Dances <disfluency> Of The </disfluency> <disfluency> With The Wolves </disfluency> Of The Wolves
yeah we talked about that one too
and <disfluency> he </disfluency> he said he did n't think it should 've gotten all those awards
he thought it was too long
but -/ 
oh I enjoyed it
I mean it was just more for my money
<disfluency> I </disfluency> I did too
yeah
I did n't think it was too long at all
um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
huh
the other one you need to go see is Sleeping With The Enemy
uh-huh
and how old are your kids
one is eight
and one is eleven
you probably do n't want to take them to see Silence Of The Lambs
<disfluency> it 's </disfluency> <disfluency> it 's not </disfluency> it 's not too cool for kids
they usually pick their own
I bet they do
you know they 've got it all figured out
yeah
they want to see all the horror movies
well and Ninja Turtles
yeah
Ninja Turtles
got to have those
but most of the time really we watch them on the video
do n't you
just massive rental
oh yeah
you bring -/ 
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> well heck that 's a lot cheaper than uh taking them out to the show -- <TURN> going to -/ I know<TURN> -- especially if you get them for a couple of nights
you do n't have to watch them all at <disfluency> one night </disfluency> one time
that 's what we do especially when it 's bad weather man
just -- <TURN> yeah<TURN> -- plug it in
of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything -- <TURN> I know<TURN> -- decent
well
it 's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they 're cheap and nobody 's got them yet
unbelievable
that 's true/ _ 
that 's true
we saw um Heroes Has Always Been Cowboys tonight
uh-huh
it was okay
it was kind of slow
and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know
<disfluency> it just </disfluency> it -/ 
and I do n't know
it one of those movies
it 's not going to be around long
it 'll be a dollar movie in no time

yeah
oh my mom and dad read all the time

yeah sure did
so I was reading the book
and it 's called Shoeless Joe
oh really
never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
um-hum _ _
that 's interesting
so -/ 
that was a good movie too
well do you think we 've covered baseball
I think so
okay
well have a good night
and I am part of a family of seven children , um ,
and my mom and dad have passed away .
During our young years we were very poor .
We did not have very much
but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained ,
and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories , reading poems , and singing to us .
One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary
and it sticks out into my mind , I guess , <disfluency> mostly </disfluency> , mainly because it was scary .
Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that <disfluency> it was </disfluency> we were OK .
Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all , as far as working around the house .
All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight .
I learned after I got married
so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking .
So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes .
Naturally , I start crying ,
and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me , either my stomach , or that I had a headache , or something was wrong with my leg .
Just anything to get out of doing my job .
So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not <disfluency> follow </disfluency> , do what she tell told me to do , she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family .
So she began to tell this story .
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family .
And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not <disfluency> come up </disfluency> , wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table .
And her little girl just complained , " I do n't want to wash the dishes .
I do n't want to .
My leg hurts ,
my head hurts .
I do n't feel good . "
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly ,
but her mother said , " How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes ? "
So she said , " Little girl , little girl , if you do n't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked you , something really , really bad is going to happen to you . "
So the little girl just said , " OK I 'll go in there and wash the dishes . "
And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time .
All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer
and it began to roll around in the air .
And before you know it , the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl 's head off .
And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying " Daddy , Daddy ! Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife . "
Now that knife , when I went to sleep it really scared me .
But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK .
Now after that , my mother continued to tell us many , many scary stories and tell us many , many , many poems .
I 'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher 's assistant .
All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school .
That was my dream , to teach school .
As I told you , in the past we were a very poor family
and I never got the chance to go to college because of this .
Uh , while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot
and she said , " Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward , on your grant to go to college . "
So she said , " Go home
and talk to your mother about it
and see if we , you know , can follow through with applying for a <disfluency> grant </disfluency> , scholarship grant for you . "
So that night I went home
and I asked my mother about it
and she said , " Baby , I really want you to go to college .
It 's always been my dream that my children all go to school .
But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you 're going to have to have to go to school
and I just do n't have the money . "
At that time my dad was in prison at the time ,
so it made it really hard for my mom .
I sat there
and I cried
but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us .
So I never got a chance to go to school .
Did anybody ?
Yes , my brother went to school .
He went to Livingstone and then <disfluency> to </disfluency> transferred to Johnson C. Smith , <disfluency> so </disfluency> to make it easier on my mom , <disfluency> to </disfluency> , as far as , you know , him staying at home and going to school too .
So he graduated from , um , Johnson C. Smith , here in Charlotte .
I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there .
<disfluency> I </disfluency> , in later years , I went on to college some
but I did n't complete the , uh , whole four years .
Um , I remember once , when I was working in a mill , and I was spinning yarn , and I was saying to myself , and , I was praying actually , and I said , " God , one day I want to work in the school system .
If I could just work , even as a teacher assistant I would be happy . "
As the years went by my prayer was answered
and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier
and the principal there came up to me and said , " Have you considered being a teacher assistant ? "
I said , " I would love to . "
So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont .
I 'd never gone to college before .
I was really afraid .
But he told me to go ahead and try it ,
so I took the entrance test ,
and they accepted me <disfluency> into </disfluency> at the school ,
and I took some courses there .
After a while , the principal said , " I would like for you to bring me your , um , transcript so I can see what your grades are like . "
Luckily I had all As .
I did very well .
And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year .
Um , <disfluency> my dream </disfluency> , my prayers were answered .
I enjoy my job very much .
I ca n't think of any job that would make me any happier .
A few years later , um , I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education .
At first I did n't want to apply for it ,
but the principal called me during the summer months and said , " Sandra the time is running out ,
you need to apply . "
And he told me I would have to write this paper .
Well I did n't like writing at the time
but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper .
And I went to , um , one of my staff members
and I asked her if she would proofread it ,
and she thought it was an excellent paper .
And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I wo n't get the scholarship .
Who cares ?
I do n't ,
just so I can work in the school I 'll be happy .
But one day I came in
and I looked at my mail
and I was accepted .
I could n't believe it .
Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity ,
so I felt very proud of myself .
So I went on and took the courses ,
and as I started I think I was taking economics .
I think that was the last class I took .
My husband became very ill with cancer
and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him
and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school .
But you would have been able to be <disfluency> a </disfluency> , a teacher if you had continued ?
Yeah ,
and at the time , I was also working in the classroom . I guess you 'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence .
And they hired a sub
but the sub did n't do that much .
I had to take over the classroom .
So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom
and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband .
<disfluency> After all of this was </disfluency> , after <disfluency> I </disfluency> , I decided not to continue I 've never pursued the fact of going back to school .
I just got to a certain age
and I said , " No I ca n't do this anymore , "
so I never went back .
But I love what I do
and , uh , anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it
so . /- 
How many different schools did you teach at ?
I 've only worked at <disfluency> two </disfluency> , two schools .
The first school I worked at was Enderly Park
and then it was closed down .
So I was in those situations where I <disfluency> first </disfluency> , <disfluency> come first </disfluency> , <disfluency> transfer last </disfluency> , come first to transfer out . 
So I had to ,
I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill
and I chose Berryhill .
I did n't particularly want to come here
and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really , really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park .
But then , after a while , I fell in love with Berryhill .
If I 'm not mistaken I think I 've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years ,
17 , 18 years I 've been here at Berryhill
so /- 
and I hope I never have to leave until I retire .
And why did the other school close down ?
Um , <disfluency> the </disfluency> , you know , I really do n't know .
Um , <disfluency> that </disfluency> , I really do n't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything ,
but they eventually tore it down because /- 
<disfluency> I was there </disfluency> I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym ,
and I do n't think they used that gym no more than three years .
I really do n't ,
I do n't remember why that school was ever closed
but it was .
And I enjoy what I do .
That 's it .
All right thank you .
okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you 're going to buy
well as a matter of fact I was thinking about that the other day
and uh I really do n't know the answer um
I would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but <disfluency> not any </disfluency> not you know a luxury type sporty one but um -- <TURN> yeah<TURN> -- something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things
oh you do want a lot of that stuff
yeah well yeah <disfluency> I like </disfluency> I like some of those things
they come in really handy
what kind of uh things are you going to consider
you know what uh you said
something <disfluency> about the </disfluency> about the /- 
well what do you call them
you said amenities -- <TURN> amenities<TURN> -- that they have
but what about um their reputation of the company or the price
um well of course I guess uh price is always the big consideration
but -/ 
it is for me
other people do n't seem to have the same problem
yeah
well <disfluency> that 's </disfluency> that 's a big one in my book
but uh um -- <TURN> yeah<TURN> -- I have preferences <disfluency> for </disfluency> uh for some um makers over others um
and I would sort of like to buy American
yeah
but you know I 'm not so totally hung up on that that I would n't buy something else
how about you
well um the last car we bought was American <disfluency> because of </disfluency> because of that reason
but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car
it does n't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be -- <TURN> oh really<TURN> -- because several things minor things sort of -/ 
but still they cost us money um that we did n't feel like we should have had to pay on a car <disfluency> that </disfluency> that was that new
um-hum _ _
you know we bought the car new
and after um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
oh
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable
and I said since when
brake pads are disposable you know
we know that
but I never thought a clutch was disposable
yeah yeah yeah
I would n't have thought so either
yeah so <disfluency> that was </disfluency> that was kind of a shock
oh
oh yeah <disfluency> I </disfluency> I guess there 's a lot <disfluency> to </disfluency> to think about when you 're trying to make that decision
yeah you know <disfluency> the less </disfluency> actually the less you spend on a car -/ 
it seems like luxury cars they 're called luxury cars even though they 're much more expensive <disfluency> like </disfluency> like uh um a Mercedes Benz they do n't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable
right
you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes
no but then um -/ 
especially not after two years
no but on the other hand I guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
really
oh I do n't know
yeah I 've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes
and -- <TURN> I think that 's -/ <TURN> I think they have a really good um quality
um-hum _ _ my uh daughter has owned two different ones
and uh you know we 've had some work done on them
but it 's not too bad
and <disfluency> the reason </disfluency> one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years
and he lived way out in the country
so he put a lot of miles on it
um-hum _ _
and you knew it had had been through a whole lot
um-hum _ _
and yet you know <disfluency> it </disfluency> it held up pretty doggone good
so -/ 
yeah
I thought they would
they seem to be really durable
yeah
so I do n't know
<disfluency> I 'm </disfluency> I 'm not ready to buy a new car yet
but I do n't know <disfluency> if </disfluency> if the next time I 'm going to try <disfluency> to </disfluency> to stay with buying something American or if I 'm going to go for a little more what I would consider to be a long-term _ _ investment
yeah
well and I guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know
you -/ 
oh it 's easy to get gas mileage in this car
it gets excellent gas mileage
yeah
yeah that 's one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones
um-hum _ _
well we talked long enough
I think so
okay
well enjoyed it
bye-bye _ _
all righty
thanks
bye-bye _ _
and I was born in San Antonio , TX ,
and the story I 'm going to tell is about my mother .
Um , a little background first .
<disfluency> Her </disfluency> , let 's see , her mother 's family were wealthy people at one time .
They owned car dealerships and extensive land .
Um , I do n't know if they were farmers or not ,
but I know they were land owners , um , many acres
and , um , her grandmother was raised in wealth .
Uh , then the Depression came
and apparently everyone lost all their money .
Um , she was raised in MO ,
and she married a man ,
this is my grandmother I 'm talking about .
And they were very poor by this point ,
and they had , I think , seven children .
And one particular Christmas , things were very , very difficult .
There was no money to buy any presents at all , um , for the children ,
and my grandfather , who was killed when my mother was 16 , this was , of course , way before that , um , he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was <disfluency> he </disfluency> , he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children
and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves
and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves .
Um , I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love .
And although I never met my grandfather , I have never forgotten that story
and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful , wonderful person he must have been .
And how long have you lived in Charlotte ?
Oh , I have lived in Charlotte , um , for a year .
Um , I lived in Charlotte for five years .
We came here in 1986 ,
we lived here for five years ,
then we moved to Raleigh for seven years
and now we 've been back one year .
Well , good .
Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext ( and hence much of the appeal ) of a Hillary Clinton - Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. Neglectful Husband . 
By running against Giuliani ( who has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress -- he denies it -- and , by all accounts , has a sham marriage ) , the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the Democratic party at the same time ! 
That 's almost enough for Chatterbox to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon . 
The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton 's marital problems a major campaign issue . 
" Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a patsy , " cried Time this week . 
But , er , would n't that be kind of a risky strategy , given his own problematic union ? 
Many have already opined that the mayor is too vituperative , too much of a loner to practice the congenial , teamwork - oriented politics of the Senate ; 
other doubters have pointed to his hardhearted , uncaring social policies . 
The last thing he needs is to draw more attention to these qualities in his personal life . 
Giuliani 's estrangement from his wife , Donna Hanover , is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today 's New York Times . 
Hanover " would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate , whether she would like him to run for Senate , or whether she would campaign for him if he did . 
But she did say in the interview , which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton 's interest in the same New York Senate seat , that Mrs. Clinton is a ' very interesting ' person . 
' I think she 's dynamic , and I think she 's very smart , and she 's an amazing speaker , ' Ms. Hanover said . " 
And , for a punch line : " Ms. Hanover 's press secretary , Joannie Danielides , said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton 's potential Senate campaign . " 
Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton 's campaign manager ? 
Indis Index Update : 
NBC , in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast last night , turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her . 
This diminishes -- slightly -- the significance of Norma Kelsey 's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick 's story . 
( One of the three is Kelsey 's sister , whose motives can be similarly questioned ; 
the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip , as only Kelsey and Broaddrick 's husband claim to have . ) 
However , Chatterbox notes that NBC , like every other responsible news organization that 's covered this story , reported that Norma Kelsey 's father 's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton , and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page wo n't . 
Its Indis Index is today up to seven . 
Saturday , September 2, 1997 , from 2:00 p. m. until 7:00 p. m. , marks a special day , as Jameson Camp will hold its first ever Jameson Grill .

Questions ? 
Dear Joe , I know what you mean about being a journalist . 
Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier . 
I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes , so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need . 
I think that is why I welcomed doing a book -- it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism . 
Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories . 
Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public . 
Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , can not be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories . 
I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) . 
In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons . 
I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur . 
So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch . 
The smart - boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully . 
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other " characters , " for lack of a better word . 
So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives . 
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there . 
While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good . 
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley . 
AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati . 
Out in the D.C. area , they looked positively exciting next to all the government - oriented contractors . 
I wonder if that means geography is destiny , and it 's still location , location , location . 
From where I am sitting , I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age . 
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it 's clear that the balance of power is shifting again , although it is not clear where it will land . 
Will the strongman of the era be AOL , AT&T , Microsoft , or one of the big media companies ? 
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ? 
I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company -- whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney -- is in charge of all our destinies : Babylon was . 
That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire 's grip on humanity . 
But we all know how that story turned out . 
Now I am getting way too philosophical , but this is my final missive , so why not ? 
Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going . 
As for me , I 'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and , I guess , life -- nobody knows .

P.S. 
You can make a difference in a child 's life . 
Each of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory . 
Each is tentative and incomplete , pointing but not fully adequate . 
Yet , I persistently hope , it is better to light one candle against ... what ? 
the darkness ? 
the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before ? 
There are grounds , reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries , to doubt a physics of semantics . 
We are on shaky ground . 
Yet when the first hard frost comes , when the birches have been swung , their crimson leaves scattered carelessly , when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn , long-legged _ _ , knowing how winter is thin , when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams , small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where , perhaps , something new is to be found . 
We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent , able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf — the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady , powerful flight . 
The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom , and perhaps more than the vaunted quark . 
But autonomous agents , we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf , we to whom " intentionality " and " purpose " are so inevitably attributed by our common languages , we are , by my definition of autonomous agents , also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties . 
If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful — more , a proper — definition of life itself , then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where " purpose " is ascribed by all of us to one another . 
Semantics enters with purpose . 
For this to be true , it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose , say , the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient , be conscious . 
I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful , an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle , now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work , then do extract work , propagating work and constraint construction , from their environment . 
Know-how _ _ 
Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now , plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material . 
I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had , individually and collectively , the embodied know-how _ _ to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world . 
Indeed , as I have emphasized before , a biosphere is a self - consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents , ways of making a living , and the search procedures , mutation , recombination , as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents . 
Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of " jobs " that were widely filled , the abundant niches of the bio-sphere _ _ . 
There is in this whole self - constructing system a wider know-how _ _ , beyond the know-how _ _ of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment . 
Yet , clearly , the know-how _ _ is distributed . 
There is no autonomous agent , no one , who knows how the whole system works , any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions , deals , steals , hopes , and frustrations . 
What in the world is " know-how _ _ " ? 
Philosophers distinguish between " know-how _ _ " and " know that . " 
I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums . 
" Know that " concerns propositions , most conveniently , human propositions . 
I know that the moon is — they tell me — not made of green cheese . 
I know that the earth circles the sun , that the earth is roughly spherical , that chairs are used to sit on . 
" Know that " brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world . 
Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can " know that " with respect to propositions . 
Unlike " know that , " " know-how _ _ " does not involve propositions about the world . 
" Know-how _ _ " involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world . 
The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest , the athletic genius high jumping , have the know-how _ _ to do it . 
Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world ? 
I certainly want to say yes , without attributing consciousness in any way . 
Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and off of genes , metabolic switching , mechanical twitching , sensing of glucose gradient , swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations . 
It knows how all right , even if it can not talk about how it gets on with its business . 
But then , try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention . 
Thank God for know-how _ _ . 
Know that is a thin veneer on a four - billion - year - old know-how _ _ skill abundant in the biosphere . 
But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents , it would seem , is also graced by the selfsame know-how _ _ . 
If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms , they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them . 
The know-how _ _ is , in these terms , nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis , work tasks , sensing , recording , and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents . 
The know-how _ _ is not outside that propagating organization . 
The know-how _ _ is the propagating organization . 
Semantics 
All of which brings us , inevitably , to the brink of semantics . 
It is simple at its roots , you see . 
An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is ( i ) food ; ( ii ) poison ; ( iii ) a signal ; ( iv ) neutral ; ( v ) something else . 
Once there is an autonomous agent , there is a semantics from its privileged point of view . 
The incoming molecule is " yuck " or " yum . " 
I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent . 
And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind . 
If yum , then there will probably be more of this type of agent , offsprings of the first . 
If yuck , it is not so likely this lineage will prosper . 
Once yuck and yum , we are not far from C. S. Pierce 's meaning - laden semiotic triad : sign , signified , significans . 
Like it or not , the glucose gradient is a sign , a predictor , of " more glucose that way . " 
Granted , the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol , any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain . 
In this restricted sense , signs are causally correlated with that which is signified . 
By contrast , the relation between the word " chair " and that which it signifies , and on which I am now sitting , is arbitrary . 
But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view ? 
If so , can " mere chemicals " be signs in the full Piercean sense ? 
I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words . 
Consider first the famous genetic code . 
Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein . 
The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached , the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids , the binding of the charged transfer RNA 's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet , the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm , tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is " translated . " 
The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules , which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a different amino acid . 
As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly different context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site , the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis . 
The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site . 
Because of this , which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging , plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA . 
Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon - codon matching mechanism . 
In short , chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations . 
It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign , signified , and significans to the genetic code . 
It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling , chemical and otherwise , within and between autonomous agents , as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that " warns " other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect _ _ secondary metabolites . 
The calculus that is Claude Shannon 's elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols . 
Nowhere in the core of Shannon 's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning , or semantics , of the information enter . 
This is no criticism , and is widely known and appreciated . 
There is , however , just a hint of semantics in Shannon 's view that the semantics resides in the " decoder . " 
I can not buy Shannon 's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent . 
If not , then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics — perhaps a set of water - filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways . 
The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding . 
But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign _ _ of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner , that sequence of events seems laden with semantics . 
If only the bacterium could tell us : 
" Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me ? 
I 've run into that one before ! 
I ducked under a boulder , and he never sensed me . 
I made it home . 
Pass me some more glucose please , Martha . " 
I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories , for I will say that we can not prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and , therefore , can not deduce that which will unfold . 
Thus , among other things , we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds . 
Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing . 
I too know the risks , including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from " intentional talk " to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question . 
But patience . 
Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold , but we also can not even translate — in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions from legal talk to normal intentional talk , let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound - wave forms monitored and masses at space - time lines as a description . 
Then let 's just be naive for the moment . 
The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say , an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know-how _ _ of that agent in making a living , or failing to make a living , in its world . 
The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered , context - dependent set of causal implications of the event , or signal , in question . 
" For want of a nail , the shoe was lost ; for want of the shoe , the horse was lost ; and for want of the horse , the rider was lost , " more or less , said Benjamin Franklin . 
The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context - dependent set of implications of the event , or signal , in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system . 
It seems hard to ascribe purpose , in the sense of acting on its own behalf , to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga . 
Of course , there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological . 
After all , I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment , defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf , then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf . 
Now , five chapters later , it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter , energy , and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf . 
My definition is a definitional circle . 
On the other hand , while the definition is circular , like F = MA and Darwin 's " natural selection " and " fitness , " that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world . 
Stones and chairs are not , by my definition , autonomous agents . 
All living cells are . 
And the stunning fact directly before us , every day , is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf . 
Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest . 
In short , once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum , it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere . 
Knowing 
What about " knowing " ? 
Daniel Dennett , in his fine book Darwin 's Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of " knowing , " if I may use that term , that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means . 
I find his hierarchy congenial and informative . 
Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher - order entities via variation and natural selection . 
I do not disagree , although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization _ _ in evolution . 
Here , in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy , detect those sources of energy , create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy , and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further . 
I wonder , in short , at the naturalness and self-generaticity _ _ of Dennett 's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres , perhaps planetary geologies , and beyond . 
But back to the past . 
Dennett distinguishes " Darwinian creatures , " " Pavlovian creatures , " " Popperian creatures , " and " Gregorian creatures . " 
A simple autonomous agent , say , a bacterium , is a Darwinian creature . 
In its simplest version , the creature evolves by mutation , also recombination and natural selection . 
For the moment , no behavioral learning is to be considered . 
So one ( or a colony or an ecosystem ) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us . 
At the next level up , say , aplysia , a nervous system is present , and the creature is capable of stimulus - response learning , à la Pavlov . 
Indeed , aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuli — the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in " expectation " of food . 
At the next level ( Dennett , perhaps properly , reserves this for us vertebrates ) is the Popperian creature . 
Popperian creatures , in Dennett 's fine phrase , have " internal models " of their world and can " run the internal model " with the clutch disengaged , rather than running the model in real time in the real world . 
This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our " hypotheses to die in our stead . " 
I love that image . 
Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely , at least humans . 
Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools literally stone knives , arrows , digging sticks , machine tools to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes . 
This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how _ _ , and more know that . 
Cultural evolution , at some point , begins to burst out - of - bounds . 
Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran . 
Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom ? 
Chinese cooking lands in Cuba , and Cuban - Chinese cuisine is invented . 
What 's next under the sun ? 
Who can say ? 
I very much like Dennett 's ladder of know-how _ _ , and eventual know that . 
Without invoking consciousness , not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject , it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems , even without evoking nerve cells . 
I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations . 
For example , bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already , for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level . 
This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus , but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter . 
As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus , why not envision a complex chemistry , say , very complex carbohydrate - synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves , which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism . 
Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self - sustaining web linking the carbohydrates , the enzymes , and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus , then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops . 
The image is not too far from how it is imagined that " idiotype " and " anti-idiotype " immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen . 
In such networks , for which there is modestly good evidence , a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences , called the " idiotype " of the first antibody . 
In turn , the second " anti-idiotype " antibody stimulates a third , which stimulates a fourth . 
But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody , hence , the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space . 
It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system . 
Popperian creatures ? 
Why can not the molecular-sensing _ _ and hypothesis-testing _ _ churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor , or not , such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by ? 
Are nerves necessary ? 
Plants , as noted , are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade . 
There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect , just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified . 
Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates . 
I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures . 
Even here , the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language , wherever new sentences can be created , is not that fundamentally different from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole . 
If the conversation we recent two-legged _ _ ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive , so too is the chemical conversation in any full - fledged ecosystem , where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another . 
I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere , with its urgent diversity in which , emboldened by all our know-how _ _ , we do get on with a very rich conversation , may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks . 
We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail _ _ , I guess . 
Smart place , a biosphere , lots to talk about . 
Four billion years of yammering . 
Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago . 
Ethics 
And what of ethics ? 
Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents ? 
Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent . 
There are deep reasons for caution . 
Hume told us long ago about the " naturalistic fallacy " : One can not deduce " ought " from " is . " 
From the fact that mothers care for their young , we can not deduce that they ought to do so , Hume argued . 
From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry , we can not deduce that he ought to have done so . 
Indeed , Hume 's injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements . 
We scientists find the facts . 
You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics . 
But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is , where do values come from at all ? 
Hume 's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category " ought . " 
The efforts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long , twisted , arduous . 
Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful , philosophers as famous as G.E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances . 
" It is wrong to kill . " 
Becomes , " Agggah ! " 
Does the positivist argument seem persuasive ? 
It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists , " only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful , " is itself not empirically verifiable . 
One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards . 
John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all " contractually " agree to , were we to know before birth that we would all be born with differing abilities and endowments . 
Thus " equality before the law " is one contract that Rawls commends to us . 
" Equality before the law " is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium . 
The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue . 
I will content myself with wondering where " value " and the rudiments of " intentionality " come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other efforts . 
Where is the place of value in a world of fact ? 
So , a short soliloquy . 
Facts are know-that _ _ statements . 
But know-how _ _ preceded know that . 
While fully aware of Hume 's injunction , I think that from the autonomous agent 's perspective , yuck or yum is primary , unavoidable , and of the deepest importance to that agent . 
I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria . 
Too much yuck , this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere . 
Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future , I can not help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around . 
And again without attributing consciousness , once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present ? 
If so , another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid . 
Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible . 
You are not responsible for acts and effects beyond your control . 
To act ethically , you must first be able to act at all . 
But what are " acts " in the first place ? 
Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician . 
Now entering Harvard , Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive , after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard , where , at age fourteen , Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands . 
Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the " doings " of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent . 
Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner . 
But all sorts of molecular vibrational , rotational , and translational motions are occurring . 
What are actions and what are mere happenings ? 
I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics . 
But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings , Dan 's happy phrasing , is relevant for E. coli , tigers , us , trees , and autonomous agents in general . 
We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism . 
Strange and interesting , is it not , that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise ? 
Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier , yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics , intentionality , value , and ethics arise with autonomous agents . 
I do not think those rudiments suffice to jump over Hume 's naturalistic fallacy . 
We can not deduce ought from is in any concrete context , but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents .

Dear Name : 
When Jerry was released from prison , he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life . 
He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path . 
Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street . 
He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live . 
The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill 's Career Academy staff for job search assistance . 
Jerry 's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately . 
But Jerry 's troubles did n't end there . 
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more . 
Unemployed , homeless and with a prison record , Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support . 
It took some time and hard work , but with the help of Goodwill , Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor 's office , find housing and conduct a more thorough job search . 
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana , many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment . 
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999 , over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job . 
Some , like Jerry , are ex-offenders _ _ . 
Some are blind , deaf or have other physical disabilities . 
More than 100 were homeless . 
But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome , like Jerry . 
With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer , his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live , Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community . 
For as long as he needs it , Goodwill will continue to help . 
Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment . 
And , with your assistance , Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job . 
Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill . 
Your generosity will help people help themselves . 
Prehistoric man in Asia Minor ( now modern Turkey ) or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land . 
Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands , marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring . 
Around 7000 b. c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now Iran to explore their surroundings . 
They eventually reached the islands , and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea . 
An important early material , obsidian , was discovered on the island of Milos . 
Obsidian is a hard , vitreous volcanic rock , which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing . 
The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers . 
The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come together as early as 5000 b. c. , and were already in place by the late Bronze Age ( c. 2700 b. c. ) . 
The major changes were not to daily tasks and routines , but to the political power base , which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages . 
Cycladic Culture 
At around 3500 b. c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands . 
The distinctive , sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs . 
You will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the Cyclades , although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on Paros . 
The people farmed and fished ; 
on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b. c. , they began to work with metals . 
The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east , importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia . 
They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble . 
The Minoans and the Myceneans 
Farther south in Crete , the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b. c. into the most significant of its age , spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy . 
Santorini ( Thira ) , the next major island north , was heavily influenced by Crete , and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time . 
The magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present , but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here . 
Around 1500 b. c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri — under feet of ash and pumice — but the whole Minoan civilization . 
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people . 
In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans ( at around 1300 b. c. ) , who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland . 
The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade . 
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad . 
The Rise of Athens 
The Dorians , who came overland from northern Europe , conquered the Mycenaeans . 
They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared . 
They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; 
south of the area , trade continued as usual . 
At the same time , city-states _ _ began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland . 
Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period . 
However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city-state _ _ was self - governing and autonomous . 
The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean . 
Culture and the arts flourished once again . 
Athletic prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b. c. , to promote friendly competition . 
Homer wrote his epic works on Chios ; and lyrical poetry was much admired , particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos . 
The preeminent islands of this era were Delos , a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens ; Samos , ruled by the tyrant Polycrates ; and Naxos , whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects . 
Archaeology shows that , during this time , societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland . 
The Persian Wars 
As Athens rose in influence and power in the West , it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire . 
From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades . 
In 490 b. c. , they captured sacred Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos . 
The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time . 
Paros and Andros contributed to the Persian armory , while others supported Athens . 
The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b. c . 
The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it . 
Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) . 
Several islands and Greek city-states _ _ agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos . 
The alliance became known as the Delian League . 
Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b. c . 
Later , in 454 b. c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age . 
In 431 b. c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta . 
Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power . 
Before the end of the war in 401 b. c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon . 
He was followed in 336 b. c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history . 
His rise to power ushered in the Hellenistic period . 
Hellenistic and Roman Periods 
When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India , the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes . 
Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire . 
Following Alexander ’s death , his lands were divided among his generals . 
Much of the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies , along with Egypt . 
Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan . 
Although in 88 b. c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands , the next major power change brought influence from the West . 
The Greek Hellenistic Empire was gradually , and peacefully , absorbed into the Roman Empire . 
The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity 
The Romans ruled a pagan empire , but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity . 
In a. d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner . 
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation . 
It was n’t until a. d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life . 
The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well - fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders . 
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands . 
Disease took a further toll . 
By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated . 
As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith . 
Unfortunately , their zeal was not matched by their discrimination . 
The crusaders swept through the land of Byzantium slaughtering Christians as well as Muslims , civilians as well as soldiers . 
Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204 , and they stripped the city of many of its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of Venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell . 
While Byzantine land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands . 
To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties . 
This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port ( skala ) which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack . 
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos . 
The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms . 
The Venetians fortified their main towns — Naxos Town and Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs _ _ _ _ that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders . 
The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands , which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade . 
After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 , Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land . 
The Knights of St. John , a holy military force , made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the Dodecanese . 
They began the process of building their strong citadels , and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands . 
However , they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe . 
A force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases . 
The Coming of the Ottoman Turks 
The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east , taking land in what is now Turkey . 
By the end of the 13th century , they began their first raids on the Aegean Islands . 
In 1453 , they took Constantinople , and immediately made it their capital , renaming it Istanbul . 
They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of St. John and , after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 , they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522 . 
In 1566 , they wrested Chios from the Genoese , bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands , but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more — Tinos was the last to fall in 1715 . 
The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled , forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean . 
Toward Greek Independence 
However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state . 
In 1770 , Russia came to aid the Greeks ( defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries ) , declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 . 
Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of Antiparos . 
Although this attempt was unsuccessful , the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength . 
The Aegean Islands played their part . 
Lesvos , Chios , and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes , and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic . 
In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered . 
The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time . 
The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state . 
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations . 
The Twentieth Century 
A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire . 
The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians . 
Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories . 
Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war . 
Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over ,00 years had had a substantial Greek population . 
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece . 
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support . 
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence . 
Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek - ruled islands just offshore . 
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands . 
Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state . 
Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire . 
His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them . 
Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands . 
After the war , in 1949 , the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation . 
But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into civil war . 
The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos . 
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable . 
At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance . 
The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse . 
In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the “ Colonels ” held sway with a repressive and brutal regime . 
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia . 
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers . 
In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the European Union ) . 
Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country . 
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece ’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments . 
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and improved . 
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible . 
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quiet times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society . 
As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .

We look forward to hearing from you . 
USA Today leads with Texas ' settlement of its product - liability lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies . 
The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesian economic crisis -- a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast to a further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns . 
The New York Times leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning abortion . 
In the Texas case , reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreed to pay about $ 15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it incurred in the treatment of smoking - related illnesses . 
That makes Texas the third state to settle such a case , joining Florida and Mississippi . 
There are , says the paper , a total of 40 such suits on file , with Minnesota 's turn coming next week . 
The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs ' lawyers hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $ 2.2 billion in fees . 
The NYT abortion survey , the first conducted by the paper since 1989 , was based on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects " a notable shift from general acceptance " of having the procedure : from 40 percent to 32 percent . 
And the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion timing : 
Sixty-one _ _ percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted during the first trimester , but only 15 percent in the second and just 7 percent in the third . 
( The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a focus on partial - birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for abortion foes . ) 
Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law on abortion could not give the correct answer . 
The WSJ notes that the just - concluded footballTV deal will probably mean even steeper cable bills in the near future . 
Some local cable companies , the paper says , expect the fees they 'll pay ESPN to go up more than 20 percent . 
And they 're in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote . 
Even non - sports fans will be affected , notes the Journal , because ESPN is usually part of basic cable service . 
( Which raises the question : Has n't technology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria-style _ _ programming choices by subscribers ? ) 
A scan of the headlines found cheek - by - jowl on the WP ' s Page A6 provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer : " [ Ex - HUD Secretary ] Cisneros 's Ex-Mistress _ _ Pleads Guilty , " " [ Labor Secretary ] Herman Denies Allegations of Influence - Selling Scheme , " and " Two Tyson Foods Executive Indicted Over Gifts to [ Ex - Agriculture Secretary ] Espy . " 
The WSJ reports that , according to an MIT survey , Americans are twice as likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrials than one for gene - cloning research . 
The NYT reports that today 's issue of the journal Science will describe an experiment in which people 's biological clocks were reset three hours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees . 
The finding , if it holds up , says the Times , may lead to a simple way for airline travelers to fight jet lag . 
Yesterday 's Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline " Paula Jones Works on Her Court Appearance , " which , illustrated by pictures of Jones , was all about the various looks she 's had since stepping on the public stage . 
The piece concluded that she 's finally graduated to an image that 's " sophisticated yet soft . " 
Today 's WP " Style " section ( that 's the opposite of substance , remember ) picks up that ball and runs with it , with a lengthy discourse on the new PJ . 
" It is , " hyperventilates the Post , one of the most jaw - dropping public make-overs _ _ ever . " 
Jones apparently has " smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to such dazzling heights . 
Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural , not neon , hues . 
Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarial pool . 
She has embraced the markers of dignity , refinement and power . " 
In true newspaper overkill fashion , the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson , national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials , and Steven Zdatny , a historian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics and politics of hair . 
The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph , but one carrying the seeds of its own destruction : 
In light of Secretary of State Albright 's imminent trip to the middle east , the New York Times , Los Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation there . 
But USA Today stays with Princess Di . 
The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday , she will " read the riot act " to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism . 
Her goal will be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel , telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting _ _ Hamas , and " no more kisses " of its leaders . 
The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context . 
Given that the troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and Israel , but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi Arabia , the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and Iran is falling apart . 
The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon , dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed , with twelve deaths the result . 
Perhaps the most striking indicator of a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that cabinet member Ariel Sharon , who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel entrenched in Lebanon in the first place , is among those urging a reconsideration of the deployment . 
Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its controlling stake of Compuserve , but it 's the Post with the news that AOL is set to take it over . 
The Wall Street Journal " Outlook " observes , " In the U.S. job market , the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers , " and states that " the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing , " which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers , which in turn led to counter-offers _ _ and higher salaries . 
This has led , says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5 - 6 percent a year . 
Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of meta - and meta-meta-pieces _ _ _ _ . 
The LAT , for instance , examines what it takes to be a new " cuddly - feely " Britain born of the national grief experience . 
But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well . 
Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill ambassador job shortly before her death , and USAT reports that Le Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family and children . 
Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story . 
" Not everyone in Calcutta , or India for that matter , is unanimous in praising the nun , whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city 's poor neighborhoods . 
Salvation -- hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters -- was her aim , not economic or social development as many others understand it , she said . " 
It 's odd , however , that in repeating this charge , the Times did n't interview the man most closely associated with it , Christopher Hitchens , or refer to the book where he set it out , The Missionary Position . 
Hmmm , wan na bet there was a copy of the book on somebody 's desk at the Times though ? 
What 's with the top-of-the-front _ _ _ _ _ _ headline the LAT puts over its picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at the U.S. Open -- " Venus Brought Back to Earth " ? 
Does n't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory ? 
How odd -- and a good illustration of how trying to shoe-horn _ _ in a " witty " headline can drive you into an idea that does n't fit or is undeserved .

Dear LTR_NAME : 
CCI has come a long way in the last five years . 
We 've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we 're ready to move boldly into the next century , and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us . 
One of the areas we 've decided to focus on is development . 
It 's clear that if we do n't increase our base of private funding , we wo n't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer . 
In 1998 , CCI served 31,484 individuals right in their own backyards . 
Where else would that many people turn if CCI were n't there to help ? 
The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range _ _ fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers . 
This in turn will help us to increase and even improve the services we offer . 
With this in mind , I am asking each one of you to make a personal contribution of $ 50 , $ 100 or even $ 1,000 to show that you believe in the work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and your finances . 
This way when we go out to ask for community support and are asked about our board giving level , we can show our in-house _ _ commitment through 100 % board participation . 
I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company , church , or service organization . 
I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with you to talk to these group if you need their help . 
We 're at an exciting juncture and it wo n't be long until we start seeing solid results from our efforts . 
Your financial support of the development process is just one step in making CCI a stronger , more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers . 
Please , make your contribution today . 
Sincerely , J. Chris Graffeo Chair 
P.S.

Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know . 
To help you see how much your contribution means , I 'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill 's mission . 
We want you to Know why your support of Goodwill is so important . 
Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that comes with work . 
" I was sad when I could n't go to the snack bar to buy a soda . 
Now I can buy a soda and spend money . 
I like working and making money . 
I have a savings account . 
I can write my name on the deposit slip . 
If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... " 
-- Maureen 
Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes sense . 
" When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no self-esteem _ _ . 
I was on welfare and without my diploma . 
Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent . 
I am now ... totally off of welfare . 
I really like my job . " 
-- Sherry 
Because people want to work . 
" I 'd never finished high school . 
I had no experience or skills ... 
The only thing I did know for sure was here 's a chance to change things for me and my children ... 
I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow . 
I wanted to be there ... 
I had my second chance to change my life . " 
-- Donna 
Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire life . 
" Before I got to Goodwill , I was on a mission . 
I just wanted a job . 
It did n't matter what the job was , I just wanted one . 
Now , I 'm on a journey . 
I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career . 
My instructor played a role like no other instructor I 've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me . " 
-- Cornell 
Each year , we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles . 
Their one common goal : they all want to work . 
A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities , but to be honest , most of the people who are n't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles . 
The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care , transportation and child care - problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities , illiteracy and lack of job skills . 
Last year , Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency _ _ . 
Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs . 
Right now , there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels like to support themselves . 
You can help them to know that feeling . 
Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs . 
Use the enclosed card and give a generous gift to Goodwill today ! 
Sincerely , James M. McClelland President 
After the attacks had occurred , while crisis managers were still sorting out a number of unnerving false alarms , Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana . 
One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One itself , a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic White House Situation Room that morning . 
While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington , by the time Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service , the President 's advisers , and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it . 
President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and , at about 10:10 , Air Force One changed course and began heading due west . 
The immediate objective was to find a safe location - not too far away - where the President could land and speak to the American people . 
The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party . 
The President 's military aide , an Air Force officer , quickly researched the options and , sometime around 10:20 , identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination . 
When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45 , personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield . 
The motorcade consisted of a military police lead vehicle and a van ; 
the proposed briefing theater had no phones or electrical outlets . 
Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President 's remarks , while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington . 
The President completed his statement , which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live , and the traveling party returned to Air Force One . 
The next destination was discussed : 
once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington , and the Vice President agreed . 
Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and control facilities , and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50 persons . 
The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days , if necessary . 
Air Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P.M. 
At about 3:15 , President Bush met with his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference . 
Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words , " We 're at war , " and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible , but the early signs all pointed to al Qaeda . 
That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending presidential directive they had labored over during the summer . 
The secretary of defense directed the nation 's armed forces to Defense Condition 3 , an increased state of military readiness . 
For the first time in history , all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded , stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country . 
Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had been implemented . 
The Pentagon had been struck ; 
the White House or the Capitol had narrowly escaped direct attack . 
Extraordinary security precautions were put in place at the nation 's borders and ports . 
In the late afternoon , the President overruled his aides ' continuing reluctance to have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force Base . 
He was flown by helicopter back to the White House , passing over the still - smoldering Pentagon . 
At 8:30 that evening , President Bush addressed the nation from the White House . 
After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the injured and protect against any further attacks , he said : " We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them . " 
He quoted Psalm 23 - " though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... " 
No American , he said , " will ever forget this day . " 
Following his speech , President Bush met again with his National Security Council ( NSC ) , expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph Allbaugh , the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
Secretary of State Colin Powell , who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks , joined the discussion . 
They reviewed the day 's events . 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME 
As the urgent domestic issues accumulated , White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten chaired a temporary " domestic consequences " group . 
The agenda in those first days is worth noting , partly as a checklist for future crisis planners . 
It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the American economy , such as Organizing federal emergency assistance . 
One question was what kind of public health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity of the fallen buildings . 
Compensating victims . 
They evaluated legislative options , eventually setting up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to run it . 
Determining federal assistance . 
On September 13 , President Bush promised to provide $ 20 billion for New York City , in addition to the $ 20 billion his budget director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole . 
Restoring civil aviation . 
On the morning of September 13 , the national airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security standards . 
Reopening the financial markets . 
After extraordinary emergency efforts involving the White House , the Treasury Department , and the Securities and Exchange Commission , aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually competitive firms of the financial industry , the markets reopened on Monday , September 17 . 
Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal operations . 
Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its liability . 
The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness . 
Though a number of agencies had some part of the task , none had security as its primary mission . 
By September 14 , Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend , at least as a first step , a new White House entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department . 
This new White House entity would be a homeland security adviser and Homeland Security Council - paralleling the National Security Council system . 
Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and other advisers . 
President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant - Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge - in his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 . 
Beginning on September 11 , Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom they encountered while following up leads in the FBI 's investigation of the 9/11 attacks . 
Eventually , 768 aliens were arrested as " special interest " detainees . 
Some ( such as Zacarias Moussaoui ) were actually in INS custody before 9/11 ; 
most were arrested after . 
Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as " risk minimization , " both to find out who had committed the attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack . 
Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public , family members , and press ; directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were " cleared " of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies ; and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret . 
INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections ; 
in the chaos after the attacks , it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials , who were following up on other leads . 
The clearance process approved by the Justice Department was time - consuming , lasting an average of about 80 days . 
We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of " special interest . " 
The detainees were lawfully held on immigration charges . 
Records indicate that 531 were deported , 162 were released on bond , 24 received some kind of immigration benefits , 12 had their proceedings terminated , and 8 - one of whom was Moussaoui - were remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service . 
The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated . 
In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the 9/11 detainee program , the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest detainee list , noting that two ( including Moussaoui ) were linked directly to a terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks . 
A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U.S. government efforts after the 9/11 attacks to monitor the American homeland , including review of Muslims ' immigration files and deportation of nonpermanent residents , forced al Qaeda to operate less freely in the United States . 
The government 's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States , and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities , was not a priority before 9/11 . 
Guidelines on this subject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance . 
However , the attacks of 9/11 changed everything . 
Less than one week after September 11 , an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act ( officially , the USA PATRIOT Act ) began to take shape . 
A central provision of the proposal was the removal of " the wall " on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities ( discussed in chapter 3 ) 
Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action , within the limits of the Constitution , to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks . 
The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26 . 
Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States 
Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 : 
( 1 ) Did any flights of Saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13 , 2001 ? 
( 2 ) Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals ? 
( 3 ) Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure ? 
First , we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals , domestic or international , took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13 , 2001 
To the contrary , every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened . 
Second , we found no evidence of political intervention . 
We found no evidence that anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a decision on the departure of Saudi nationals . 
The issue came up in one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired , and Clarke said he approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level . 
Clarke told us , " I asked the FBI , Dale Watson ... to handle that , to check to see if that was all right with them , to see if they wanted access to any of these people , and to get back to me . 
And if they had no objections , it would be fine with me . " 
Clarke added , " I have no recollection of clearing it with anybody at the White House . " 
Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about the Saudi request shortly after 9/11 , he said he had not talked to the Saudis and did not ask anyone to do anything about it . 
The President and Vice President told us they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media . 
None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this matter from any political appointee . 
Third , we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights . 
The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI 's requirements that passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights departed . 
The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart . 
The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their departures . 
They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion . 
Our own independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights . 
PLANNING FOR WAR 
By late in the evening of September 11 , the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day . 
Vice President Cheney described the President 's mood as somber . 
The long day was not yet over . 
When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up , President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers , a group he would later call his " war council . " 
This group usually included Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , General Hugh Shelton , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ( later to become chairman ) General Myers , DCI Tenet , Attorney General Ashcroft , and FBI Director Robert Mueller . 
From the White House staff , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group , often joined by their deputies , Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten . 
In this restricted National Security Council meeting , the President said it was a time for self - defense . 
The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks , but also those who harbored them . 
Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the Arab states that the time to act was now . 
He said we would need to build a coalition . 
The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China . 
Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers , including Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , Sudan , and Iran . 
He wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries , pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble . 
President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12 . 
In the first meeting , he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind of enemy . 
The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them . 
As they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign , they considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the " elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life , " an aim that would include pursuing other international terrorist organizations in the Middle East . 
Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted . 
The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm . 
The United States would need to integrate diplomacy , financial measures , intelligence , and military actions into an overarching strategy . 
The principals also focused on Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda . 
They concluded that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States , it too would be at risk . 
The same day , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani ambassador to the United States , Maleeha Lodhi , and the visiting head of Pakistan 's military intelligence service , Mahmud Ahmed . 
Armitage said that the United States wanted Pakistan to take seven steps : to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for Bin Ladin ; to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all necessary military and intelligence operations ; to provide territorial access to U.S. and allied military intelligence and other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda ; to provide the United States with intelligence information ; to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts ; to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going to Afghanistan ; and , if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to harbor them , to break relations with the Taliban government . 
Pakistan made its decision swiftly . 
That afternoon , Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism . 
The next day , the U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders had agreed to all seven demands . 
" Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds with us , " the embassy noted . 
" Musharraf said the GOP [ government of Pakistan ] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price . 
His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer . 
To counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions . " 
At the September 13 NSC meeting , when Secretary Powell described Pakistan 's reply , President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban . 
He also ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban . 
The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban , step back , wait to see if they got the message , and hit them hard if they did not . 
He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban 's behavior . 
President Bush also tasked the State Department , which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper titled " Game Plan for a Political - Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan . " 
The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control . 
It therefore detailed specific U.S. demands for the Taliban : surrender Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants , including Ayman al Zawahiri ; tell the United States what the Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations ; close all terrorist camps ; free all imprisoned foreigners ; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions . 
The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban : produce Bin Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours , or the United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure . 
The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply . 
Therefore , State and Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan . 
Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence , basing , and other support from countries , according to their capabilities and resources . 
Finally , the plan detailed a public U.S. stance : America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat , punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks , hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists , work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks , and avoid malice toward any people , religion , or culture . 
President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have to invade Afghanistan with ground troops . 
But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options were disappointing . 
Tommy Franks , the commanding general of Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , told us that the President was dissatisfied . 
The U.S. military , Franks said , did not have an off-the-shelf _ _ _ _ plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan . 
The existing Infinite Resolve options did not , in his view , amount to such a plan . 
All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September 15 - 16 , as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David . 
Present were Vice President Cheney , Rice , Hadley , Powell , Armitage , Rumsfeld , Ashcroft , Mueller , Tenet , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , and Cofer Black , chief of the DCI 's Counterterrorist Center . 
Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations . 
He proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda . 
These CIA teams would act jointly with the military 's Special Operations units . 
President Bush later praised this proposal , saying it had been a turning point in his thinking . 
General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that the military had put together . 
It drew on the Infinite Resolve " phased campaign " plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998 . 
But Shelton added a new element - the possible significant use of ground forces - and that is where President Bush reportedly focused his attention . 
After hearing from his senior advisers , President Bush discussed with Rice the contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion . 
Rice prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday morning , September 17 . 
" The purpose of this meeting , " he recalled saying , " is to assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism . 
It starts today . " 
In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting , President Bush charged Ashcroft , Mueller , and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense . 
President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed . 
The State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were imminent . 
In addition , Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in Afghanistan , including the administration 's first Memorandum of Notification on Bin Ladin . 
Shortly thereafter , President Bush authorized broad new authorities for the CIA . 
President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the ultimatum . 
The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide . 
Finally , he directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to target al Qaeda 's funding and seize its assets . 
NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising _ _ by September 18 . 
Also by September 18 , Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid , search - and - rescue equipment and personnel , and medical assistance teams . 
On the same day , Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed regarding a two - day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U.S. demands . 
Omar 's response was " not negative on all these points . " 
But the administration knew that the Taliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin . 
The pre/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive , National Security Presidential Directive 9 , now titled " Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States . " 
The directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism , not just on al Qaeda . 
It also incorporated the President 's determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them . 
It included a determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . 
The new directive - formally signed on October 25 , after the fighting in Afghanistan had already begun - included new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist group . 
The old draft directive on al Qaeda became , in effect , the first annex . 
The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks , dry up their financial support , and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction . 
The goal was the " elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life . " 
" PHASE TWO " AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ 
President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein 's regime might have had a hand in it . 
Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years , and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in ongoing combat operations . 
As a former pilot , the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting , especially Hanjour 's high - speed dive into the Pentagon . 
He told us he recalled Iraqi support for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well . 
Speculating about other possible states that could be involved , the President told us he also thought about Iran . 
Clarke has written that on the evening of September 12 , President Bush told him and some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to 9/11 . 
" See if Saddam did this , " Clarke recalls the President telling them . 
" See if he 's linked in any way . " 
While he believed the details of Clarke 's account to be incorrect , President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at some point , asking him about Iraq . 
Responding to a presidential tasking , Clarke 's office sent a memo to Rice on September 18 , titled " Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in the September 11 Attacks . " 
Rice 's chief staffer on Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al Qaeda . 
The memo found no " compelling case " that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks . 
It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports , including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer ( discussed in chapter 7 ) and a Polish report that personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event . 
Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak , the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein 's regime . 
Finally , the memo said , there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons . 
On the afternoon of 9/11 , according to contemporaneous notes , Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible . 
The notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training sites . 
He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities . 
The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time - not only Bin Ladin . 
Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the time , he had been considering either one of them , or perhaps someone else , as the responsible party . 
According to Rice , the issue of what , if anything , to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David . 
Briefing papers on Iraq , along with many others , were in briefing materials for the participants . 
Rice told us the administration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks . 
She recalled that in the first Camp David session chaired by the President , Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq . 
Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during " this round " of the war on terrorism . 
A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action : al Qaeda , the Taliban , and Iraq . 
It argued that of the three , al Qaeda and Iraq posed a strategic threat to the United States . 
Iraq 's long - standing involvement in terrorism was cited , along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction . 
Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz - not Rumsfeld - argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked . 
Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind 9/11 . 
" Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with , " Powell told us . " 
And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem . " 
Powell said that President Bush did not give Wolfowitz 's argument " much weight . " 
Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following week , Powell said , President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority . 
President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the morning session on September 15 . 
Iraq was not even on the table during the September 15 afternoon session , which dealt solely with Afghanistan . 
Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday , September 16 , he said the focus would be on Afghanistan , although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the 9/11 attacks . 
At the September 17 NSC meeting , there was some further discussion of " phase two " of the war on terrorism . 
President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if Baghdad acted against U.S. interests , with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi oil fields . 
Within the Pentagon , Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with Iraq . 
Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined " Preventing More Events , " he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack , maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat . 
Wolfowitz contended that the odds were " far more " than 1 in 10 , citing Saddam 's praise for the attack , his long record of involvement in terrorism , and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center . 
The next day , Wolfowitz renewed the argument , writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator _ _ in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives - laden plane into CIA headquarters , and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis ' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight . 
Given this background , he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots , seeing a " failure of imagination " and a mind-set _ _ that dismissed possibilities . 
On September 19 , Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency plans . 
Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the conflict , the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban , al Qaeda , and Afghanistan . 
Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon 's war plans and challenged certain assumptions underlying them , as any prudent organization or leader should do . 
General Tommy Franks , the commanding general of Central Command , recalled receiving Rumsfeld 's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility . 
He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan . 
But , he told us , he now wondered how that action was connected to what might need to be done in Somalia , Yemen , or Iraq . 
On September 20 , President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and the two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead . 
When Blair asked about Iraq , the President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem . 
Some members of his administration , he commented , had expressed a different view , but he was the one responsible for making the decisions . 
Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on military responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11 - a request President Bush denied , arguing that the time was not right . 
( CENTCOM also began dusting off plans for a full invasion of Iraq during this period , Franks said . ) 
The CENTCOM commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11 , both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of Iraq , where the United States was flying regular missions to enforce Iraqi no - fly zones . 
Franks said that President Bush again turned down the request . 
Having issued directives to guide his administration 's preparations for war , on Thursday , September 20 , President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress . 
" Tonight , " he said , " we are a country awakened to danger . " 
The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998 embassy bombings and , for the first time , declared that al Qaeda was " responsible for bombing the USS Cole . " 
He reiterated the ultimatum that had already been conveyed privately . 
" The Taliban must act , and act immediately , " he said . 
" They will hand over the terrorists , or they will share in their fate . " 
The President added that America 's quarrel was not with Islam : 
" The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends ; 
it is not our many Arab friends . 
Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists , and every government that supports them . " 
Other regimes faced hard choices , he pointed out : 
" Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make : 
Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . " 
President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin . 
" Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda , but it does not end there , " he said . 
" It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped , and defeated . " 
The President had a message for the Pentagon : " The hour is coming when America will act , and you will make us proud . " 
He also had a message for those outside the United States . 
" This is civilization 's fight , " he said . 
" We ask every nation to join us . " 
President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command 's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2 . 
Originally titled " Infinite Justice , " the operation 's code word was changed - to avoid the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God alone - to the operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan : " Enduring Freedom . " 
The plan had four phases . 
In Phase One , the United States and its allies would move forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan and Pakistan . 
This occurred in the weeks following 9/11 , aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the United States . 
In Phase Two , air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets . 
In an innovative joint effort , CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban . 
The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7 . 
The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured - after arduous effort - by the end of that month . 
In Phase Three , the United States would carry out " decisive operations " using all elements of national power , including ground troops , to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . 
Mazar-e-Sharif _ _ _ _ , in northern Afghanistan , fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on November 9 . 
Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul . 
By early December , all major cities had fallen to the coalition . 
On December 22 , Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader from Kandahar , was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan 's interim administration . 
Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the Taliban . 
In December 2001 , Afghan forces , with limited U.S. support , engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called Tora Bora . 
In March 2002 , the largest engagement of the war was fought , in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot _ _ _ _ area south of Gardez , against a large force of al Qaeda jihadists . 
The three - week battle was substantially successful , and almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan 's equally mountainous and lightly governed frontier provinces . 
As of July 2004 , Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are still believed to be at large . 
In Phase Four , civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task of what the armed forces call " security and stability operations . " 
Within about two months of the start of combat operations , several hundred CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers , backed by the striking power of U.S. aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts , had combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy the Taliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda . 
They had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemy 's known leaders . 
Mohammed Atef , al Qaeda 's military commander and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot , had been killed by a U.S. air strike . 
According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy , the CIA provided intelligence , experience , cash , covert action capabilities , and entrance to tribal allies . 
In turn , the U.S. military offered combat expertise , firepower , logistics , and communications . 
Dear Name , 
It 's tough growing up today . 
We know that children do better when they have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them . 
When young people do n't have that support , they need other resources for encouragement to guide them along the way . 
Big Sisters helps bridge that gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters volunteers . 
Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully reach their potential , experience life 's opportunities and perhaps begin to dream . 
The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations from which healthy values and strong self-confidence _ _ can grow , helping youth become strong , independent adults of tomorrow . 
This year we will serve over 1,000 girls through our mentoring programs . 
This is an impressive number ; 
but for each girl served , more are left unserved . 
Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister . 
You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and our $ 200,000 goal . 
If you are a regular contributor to the Annual Campaign , I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by 10 % . 
If you have not supported Big Sisters in the past , please join me in doing so by completing and returning the enclosed pledge form . 
Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth . 
But caring adults like you can reach out and help . 
It 's the perfect time to make a world of difference . 
Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who have become dependent on it . 
Their complaint : the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry-level _ _ jobs do n't include . 
That 's where you -- and Goodwill -- come in . 
We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare . 
Last year , Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs , more than double the number we placed in 1993 . 
While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea , the people who need jobs are floundering . 
We need your support to continue getting people off of public assistance . 
Welfare is not the answer . 
And welfare reform is an uncertain solution with an unknown starting date . 
Goodwill works . 
Right now . 
Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today .

Dear Mailhouse donor reminder : 
You and I have done some important work together . 
We 've helped people break free of the welfare cycle . 
We 've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce . 
We 've expanded Goodwill 's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most . 
Of course , we 've played different roles . 
You have helped make Goodwill 's work possible with your previous support . 
Goodwill has devised the programs that turned your investment into results . 
Who has benefited from our partnership ? 
Everyone has . 
When you and I help somebody find a job , one more person joins the ranks of tax payers , fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer . 
There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working : physical and mental disabilities , history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem _ _ . 
And there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives . 
So our work must continue . 
Everyone benefits from the work we do together . 
Many people need our help . 
Please continue our important partnership . 
Support Goodwill with a generous donation today . 
Sincerely , James M. McClelland President

Dear Personal Donor : 
In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job , Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes . 
His job objectives call for him to do it in 30 . 
He has no time to waste . 
Neither do we . 
With the help of friends like you , Goodwill has continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing society . 
We do n't waste time as we are helping the community . 
And we do n't waste money . 
The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to continue our mission of helping people prepare for , find and keep jobs . 
In their December , 1995 review of the nation 's best charities , U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five " Standout Good Guys . " 
The magazine stated that Goodwill ( as well as the other standouts ) is " uniquely effective , innovative or valuable . " 
While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report 's endorsement , the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us . 
Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier , the positive effects radiate throughout our community : The business community welcomes not only another worker , but a consumer with increased purchasing power . 
Parents act as role models of self-sufficiency _ _ instead of dependency . 
Tax dollars that would have been spent on public assistance are saved . 
You and I know that solutions to difficult problems do n't just happen . 
At Goodwill , it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day : 
A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients : 
" You can earn the money to support yourself and your family , " she says . 
" You can get off welfare . 
I know you can ... I did . " 
A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program . 
once his tears have subsided , he confirms what his classmates have already figured out : he just received a job offer -- his first in five years . 
Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center , a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs . 
On his way home , he shares the story with four people at a street corner . 
At the next corner he tells five more . 
In order to develop job skills , a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill 's industrial division . 
It takes a long time for him to gain the self-confidence _ _ to work elsewhere in the community . 
Eventually , he turns your support into a payoff for all of us . 
He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself . 
These people and their successes are real . 
Just like the respect we 've earned from U.S. News & World Report . 
Just like the impact Goodwill 's work has on our community . 
Real work . 
Real results . 
A real difference in people 's lives -- in all of our lives . 
The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste . 
Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of their success . 
Your support helps provide real solutions . 
Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously to Goodwill today . 
Sincerely , Jack Dustman Board Member and Former Chairman 
There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC 's This Week this morning , furrow-browed _ _ and " heartbroken with all the evidence coming out " against the president . 
Last week , when the Lewinsky story was only a few hours old , Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to demonstrate his concern . 
" These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president . 
There 's no question that , if they 're true , they ... could lead to impeachment proceedings . " 
Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos ' eager show of independence from the president ? 
The problem is n't so much his disloyalty . 
Political figures turn on each other from time to time , for good and bad reasons ; 
we 're used to it . 
Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and does n't want to seem a Clinton stooge . 
By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges , and treating Clinton 's familiar defenses as the lies and half - lies they seem to be , Stephanopoulos shows he 's not a fool . 
The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place . 
During the 1992 campaign , when Gennifer Flowers first brought Clinton 's philandering to public attention , Stephanopoulos -- as Clinton 's chief spinner , distracter , and all - around bullshit artist -- played a crucial role in discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth , namely that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem . 
( Do n't say Stephanopoulos did n't know . 
Again , he 's not a fool . ) 
Simply put , Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments . 
The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on tape . 
Early in the film , with the Flowers crisis in full bloom , Sam Donaldson interviews Stephanopoulos , who blames it all on the " Republican attack machine . " 
" Gov. Clinton has no character problem , " Stephanopoulos declares . 
Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity . 
" He said he had problems in his marriage , " says Stephanopoulos , correcting Donaldson 's deviation from the pre-scripted _ _ fudge - phrase of the day . 
( Today , of course , the president 's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply did n't care . ) 
Near the end of The War Room , Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours , which he is about to publicize . 
Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet . 
" You would be laughed at ... " he tells the caller . 
" I guarantee you that if you do this you 'll never work in Democratic politics again ... . 
Nobody will believe you and people will think you 're scum . " 
You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander - protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught . 
He was one of Clinton 's principal enablers , to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today 's New York Times . 
When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton , they do n't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos , Carville ( and a cooperative campaign press corps ) helped to put over in 1992 . 
Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst . 
It 's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s _ _ _ to soberly rue the damage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy , without any apology for his own role . 
Much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers ( e. g. : Dick Morris , Marv Albert ) rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture . 
But usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required . 
Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country . 
The holiday season is the time of year when we 're all busy buying gifts , baking goodies , decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends . 
This is the time of year when we give thanks for the warmth and love that surrounds us . 
And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are . 
Pleasant Run cares for at-risk _ _ children and families . 
We do this through a wide range of programs including community - based , therapeutic foster care , group homes and our treatment center . 
Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes . 
Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for . 
Many of the children have no homes ; no memories of joy from past holidays . 
Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy , happy environment but do n't have the resources to make it possible . 
Your contribution will make a difference in a child 's life . 
It may help a family stay together . 
It can certainly make happy holiday memories . 
A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open . 
A gift means a family will have a holiday meal , cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on . 
Your gift will go beyond the holiday season . 
It can help purchase clothing , school supplies , books and educational tools throughout the year . 
Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run . 
Let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have . 
We wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love . 
Sincerely , Mary Roth Executive Director

Dear Name : 
The 1999 Invest in Youth Campaign is in full swing . 
As a former board member , the success of the YMCA is still important to me . 
We must be able to reach all youth and families interested in values - based programs . 
The Invest in Youth campaign helps insure this . 
New initiatives in the inner - city are taking hold . 
The Urban Mission Branch is reaching out to middle school youth with programs based on caring , honesty , respect and responsibility for themselves and others . 
For some , these are very different messages from the ones heard in the street . 
They are learning to make positive choices concerning alcohol , tobacco and other drugs and to support each other when those choices are challenged . 
You have shared in the vision and the leadership of the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis . 
I now invite you to continue to support the mission and the message that is so important to building strong kids , strong families and strong communities . 
Please consider joining the Chairman 's Roundtable with a gift of $ 1,000 . 
I have enclosed a pledge card for your convenience . 
We would like to announce the success of this year 's campaign at the Annual Meeting on April 27 , so please return your pledge or gift within the next 30 days . 
Thank you . 
Sincerely , Richard H. Gilbert , Jr. Past Board Member YMCA of Greater Indianapolis 
Jerusalem 's recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that . 
At the beginning of the second millennium b. c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem . 
The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant " city of Shalim " or " founded by Shalim . " 
Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace , for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for " peace " : shalom and salaam , respectively . 
If true , this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth . 
Biblical Jerusalem 
In the Bible , Genesis 14 : 18 - 20 records that Abraham visited the city of " Salem " in approximately 1800 b. c. and was blessed by the city 's ruler , Melchzedik , who offered him bread and wine . 
The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior , King David , who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b. c . 
The Bible describes how David 's soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise . 
Warren 's Shaft , part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th - century archaeologists and open to visitors , might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David 's army . 
Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel , David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans , dedicated priests , magical poets and musicians , and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city . 
He also brought the Ark of the Covenant , the portable tabernacle containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai , to the Spring of Gihon , just outside the walls of Jerusalem . 
There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple , built in approximately 960 b. c. on Mt. Moriah , the high point at the northern end of the city . 
The Temple ( today known as the " First " Temple ) was completed by David 's son and successor , King Solomon . 
According to biblical tradition , although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed unworthy of constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands . 
At the Temple 's dedication , Solomon addressed his God : " ... the Heavens , even the Heaven of the Heavens , can not contain Thee ; how much less this House that I have built ? " 
The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt. Moriah , on which it stood , where Abraham was called to sacrifice his son Isaac . 
Along with this splendid house of worship , Solomon built a royal palace , mansions for his wives , temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married , and towers for the defense of the capital . 
Under the wise reign of Solomon , the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia . 
The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon ; 
the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years . 
But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule . 
The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets . 
In 701 b. c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem . 
Thanks to King Hezekiah 's hidden water tunnel , the city narrowly escaped destruction . 
The end of David 's dynasty came in 587 b. c. , when Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem . 
When it fell , the Temple and all the buildings were burned . 
The people of the once - glorious city were forced into an exile known as " the Babylonian Captivity . " 
In time , the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b. c . 
The city was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians , but rebuilding was slow work . 
The Second Temple was finished in 515 b. c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins . 
Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b. c. under Alexander the Great and , subsequently , to his Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian Seleucids . 
When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism , Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b. c. and , against all odds , restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem . 
The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices ; the eight - day celebration of Hanukkah ( Feast of Dedication ) commemorates their victory . 
The Hasmonean dynasty , descendants of the Maccabee family , ruled an independent Jewish Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee . 
Jerusalem grew , surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the Jaffa Gate . 
The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey 's Roman legions arrived in 63 b. c . 
Roman Jerusalem 
After the initial years of Roman administration and political infighting , Rome installed Herod ( scion of a family from Idumea , a Jewish kingdom in the desert ) as King of Judea . 
He reigned from 37 to 4 b. c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate , the foundation of which still stand . 
Several palaces were built and a water system installed . 
Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple , making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire . 
The courtyard around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims , and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks . 
One of these walls , the Western Wall , is today a major reminder of Jerusalem 's greatness under Herod . 
A massive fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount , which Herod named " Antonia " in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor , Mark Antony . 
For all his accomplishments , Herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects ; he taxed , he tortured , and he ordered the massacre of male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah . 
When Jesus was born in about 4 b. c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod 's paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new - born infant . 
They returned to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth , making pilgrimages to Jerusalem . 
According to biblical accounts , Jesus spent his life ministering in the Galilee Valley . 
In about a. d. 30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem , which was in unrest at this time , dissatisfied with Roman domination . 
Jesus 's entry into the Temple caused a commotion ; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests , who were under direct Roman rule . 
Jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion , a Roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals . 
In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation , the execution in Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by itself have an immediate effect on history . 
After Jesus 's crucifixion , harsh Roman rule continued until a. d. 66 , when the Jews rebelled . 
For four years Jewish zealots fought against the might of Rome . 
At the end , the Roman general Titus laid siege to Jerusalem in a. d. 70 , finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders . 
Those who did n't escape were executed or sold into slavery . 
The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed . 
The last of the zealots held out for another three years at Masada ( see page 76 ) . 
Half a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this first revolt against Rome , a number unequaled in ancient warfare . 
Christian and Islamic Jerusalem 
For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins , until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter . 
In outrage , the Jews began a second revolt against Rome , led by Simon bar Kochba . 
The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated , but , in the end , Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life . 
The planned new Roman city , Aelia Capitolina , was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem , and Jews were barred from residing there for all time . 
Jerusalem 's physical existence as a spiritual city seemed finished , but its spiritual power for Jews , and for the struggling new Christian religion , remained . 
For the next two centuries Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history . 
But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth century , and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again . 
Queen Helena , a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great , made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites associated with Jesus 's life . 
She found that the city 's most beautiful Roman temple , dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite , stood on the site of the crucifixion . 
The temple was demolished and a vast , Classical - style church was built around Golgotha ( the hill where Jesus 's crucifixion was believed to have taken place ) . 
Throughout Jerusalem , other spots important to Jesus 's life were commemorated with religious structures . 
Pilgrims came from all over the Roman ( and , later , Byzantine ) Empire during the following centuries , but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614 , when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again . 
In 629 , Jerusalem was recaptured by the Byzantines . 
Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation , Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam . 
The Temple Mount was identified in Islamic tradition as " the farthest spot " ( in Arabic , el-aksa ) , the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one night from Mecca on a winged horse , as described in the 17th chapter of the Koran . 
From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise . 
The rock on the Temple Mount from which he ascended , at or close to the site of the ruined Temple , was commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691 . 
The Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem 's most striking monument ; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created . 
By about 715 , the El-Aksa Mosque , third holiest place of prayer in Islam ( after Mecca and Medina ) , had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount . 
Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries . 
In 1099 , under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and Tancred , the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by slaughtering both Muslims and Jews . 
Crusaders , Mamelukes , and Turks 
The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head . 
They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin . 
During the Sixth Crusade ( 1228 - 1229 ) , the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation . 
The Christians , however , could not hold the city . 
After they lost Jerusalem , a Mongol invasion swept through , and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control , ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years . 
The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions . 
Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era , but the past thousand years had taken their toll : 
Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times . 
In the early 16th century , the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East . 
Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517 , remaining under their control for 400 years . 
Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day . 
Fountains , inns , religious schools , and barracks were constructed . 
But when Suleiman died , his empire , including Jerusalem , began a long period of decline . 
The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century , when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year . 
19th - Century Aspirations 
At the same time , many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine ( as the Holy Land was traditionally called ) and especially to Jerusalem . 
In the 1890s , Theodor Herzl ( 1860 - 1904 ) worked to organize a movement , Zionism , to create a Jewish state . 
Chaim Weizmann ( 1874 - 1952 ) , a scientist born in Russia but later a British subject , did much to put Herzl 's hopes into practice . 
Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , supporting the idea of a Jewish " national home " in Palestine that also respected the rights of existing non-Jewish people already living there . 
The problem was that British strategists , who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in 1917 , had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab allies . 
In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate to administer Palestine . 
Jerusalem flourished during the early years of the Mandate . 
Modern neighborhoods , hospitals , schools , and the Hebrew University were built in West Jerusalem , the new Jewish enclave . 
But Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine led to increasing strife ; by 1946 , Jerusalem was an armed camp . 
In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states , one Jewish and one Arab , with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither . 
But lacking the means to enforce its decision , the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948 . 
Modern Israel 
The State of Israel was declared during this difficult time . 
In response , member states of the Arab League sent troops to help the Palestinian Arabs . 
West Jerusalem , separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation , held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas . 
Jews were evacuated from the Old City 's Jewish Quarter , and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem . 
As a result of armistice agreements in 1949 , Jerusalem was divided : 
West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control , and East Jerusalem ( including the Old City , with its Jewish , Muslim , Christian , and Armenian quarters ) came under Jordanian authority . 
Free access to holy sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice agreements . 
However , with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire , no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem . 
For the next 19 years , Jerusalem was two cities . 
Political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967 . 
Within three days the city was completely in Israeli hands , and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited . 
Jerusalem 's mayor , Teddy Kollek , spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development , adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly mediating the concerns of Jerusalem 's many communities . 
Today , as always , Jerusalem is a city of controversies : religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews ; Palestinians calling for independence ; many residents protesting a wave of high-rise _ _ development that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis .

Dear Bill : 
This is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things differently , things that will make our lives better and improve the quality of our life . 
As you begin that process this year , I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth , Inc. 
MCCOY Inc. , originally founded as a government agency but re-organized _ _ in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit _ _ _ _ , is a county - wide youth services coordinating , planning , and convening agency . 
Its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies , programs , and systems that serve our community 's youth . 
In addition to that behind-the-scenes _ _ _ _ role , MCCOY has taken an out-front _ _ role in developing a Summer Bus Pass , neighborhood youth councils , and the We Value Youth information line . 
It is our goal that every young person in Marion County have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in their growth toward a positive adulthood . 
I am hopeful that you as an individual and Meridian Insurance as a corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of MCCOY . 
I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community . 
I obviously ca n't tell the whole story of MCCOY in a single letter but I hope this provides an overview of the scope of our work . 
I will call you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest . 
Please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the Marion County Commission on Youth . 
Dear , 
Kids today face overwhelming pressures , everything from trouble at home to gangs and drugs . 
Youngsters often find themselves feeling alienated and alone . 
That 's where the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis come in . 
We reach out to kids -- especially those from disadvantaged neighborhoods where the risks are highest . 
We give them a chance to realize their own potential by giving them a place where they can develop a sense of competence , of usefulness , a sense of belonging and of influence . 
To accomplish this , the five area Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis must be open and available when the kids need them , with the staff and programs the kids need to reach and grow into responsible and caring citizens . 
This costs money . 
Money for programs , for equipment , and for repairs and improvements to club facilities . 
Your contribution last year of helped us get where we are today . 
We are counting on you now to help us get where we need to be tomorrow . 
Would you please consider a gift of the same in 1999 ? 
Please , give generously . 
The kids are depending on you . 
Respectfully , James Campbell President of the Board Deputy Chief , Indianapolis Police Department 
A United Way Agency 
Even More " Proving Rape " 
Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page 's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick 's rape charges against Bill Clinton ( see " Proving Rape , " " More Proving Rape , " as well as Michael Kinsley 's " Readme " column in the current issue ) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility . 
With that in mind , Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty ( henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index . 
Here 's how it works : 
Publications that refuse to acknowledge ( even if to refute the importance of ) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense . 
They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact -- and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up _ _ without making note of said inconvenient fact . 
Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame . 
Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin . 
( Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase " intellectual dishonesty , " because it 's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest . 
But Chatterbox does n't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense . ) 
For the purposes of this survey , the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page , because , in essence , it is . 
The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma Kelsey , the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating Broaddrick 's rape accusation , is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton . 
( A responsible account of the whole controversy in today 's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration . ) 
The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19 . 
Because it has published three times since the initial omission , it scores an additional three points . 
And because it published an editorial Feb. 22 taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story -- and still did n't mention the pardon -- it scores an extra two points . 
That comes to a total of six . 
Chatterbox feels certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up _ _ tomorrow to tonight 's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview , which means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest ! 
Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having " eventually convinced " Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times ( as the Times reports in today 's story ) . 
But the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis Index 's scoring procedures . 
And besides , Rabinowitz 's efforts on the Times ' behalf were n't really unethical , just puzzling , given the two newspapers ' intense rivalry . 
When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief , Alan Murray , who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story ( and -- full disclosure -- is Chatterbox 's former boss ) , to comment about a Journal employee 's feeding sources to the Times , he replied : " I do n't really have any comment on what the edit page did . They do their thing , we do ours . " Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment . 
For her part , Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound . 
" Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a. m. , and that she had refused an interview , " Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail _ _ message . 
" I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post ' s Steve Dunleavy , and refused a Times reporter . 
She said Dunleavy caught her by surprise . 
She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter . 
I told her it would be -- certainly as all right as talking to Dunleavy . 
She said , ' Well , I 'm sorry I did n't . ' 
She said she would if he called again . 
I passed this on to [ Times reporter ] Felicity Barringer during our second day 's interview chat . 
So -- that 's how it happens that in the New York Times piece today I 'm described -- solemnly -- as having ' eventually convinced ' her to repeat the story to the New York Times . "

Dear Friend : 
What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ? 
Little ones , like Baby Jessica , caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents . 
Older kids , like Tracy and Kerry , left homeless after a recent murder-suicide _ _ in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad . 
Young adults , like Mary T. , a jobless mother of three , trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime - ridden neighborhood . 
Real people ! 
There are thousands more . 
Families are being torn apart , and too often , children are the victims . 
Kids like Tommie J. , made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father ; Alice , sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders ; and John H. , a recovering alcoholic , rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again . 
Pleasant Run Children 's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago . 
Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War . 
Today , we serve children and families with a multitude of problems : emotional , physical , psychological and sexual abuse . 
Some come from families where , through therapy , there is hope for reunification . 
For others , " families " are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live . 
The biggest tragedy is that the problems do n't go away ; they only grow . 
In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families . 
In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families . 
In 1996 , these figures will triple . 
The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy , loving , and productive members of our society . 
They welcome the chance to belong , to become self - sufficient , to regain their self-esteem _ _ and confidence . 
Often it is a long , hard struggle , but the results are well worth it . 
For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families , we need your support . 
The Funding sources are shrinking , but the needs grow explosively . 
Please " help good kids get better " by sending us a contribution today . 
Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows .

Dear , 
Think of your greatest accomplishments . 
Think of the joy and success they bring to you and your loved ones . 
Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job . 
Michael was born with cerebral palsy . 
Upon entering the work force , he discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities . 
For several years he performed packaging and clerical work . 
His most recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs _ _ eliminated his position . 
For 18 long months Michael could not find a job . 
He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive . 
Finally , Michael called Goodwill . 
At Goodwill , Michael 's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match _ _ where his people skills could shine . 
After three interviews , Michael proved that he was the right person for the job . 
As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments , he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night . 
At last , he has found success in a job that he loves . 
Now his goals are set on moving up in the company . 
Every year , thousands of people come to Goodwill . 
Like Michael , they share two common characteristics . 
They face some barrier to employment and they want to work . 
With support from people like you , they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency _ _ that comes with it . 
And then the pay-off _ _ begins for the entire community . 
Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes . 
Last year , participants in Goodwill programs earned -- and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $ 3.5 million . 
Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three - quarters of a million dollars in public assistance . 
The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents , however . 
The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in , money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success , not hopelessness . 
Wo n't you help make all of these successes possible ? 
Please send the largest contribution you can comfortably make . 
Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word . 
Sincerely , James M. McClelland President 
P.S. 
Your gift will make a difference . 
For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year , we returned $ 1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments . 
Dear Friend : 
This is not newsletter . 
It is a fund - raising appeal . 
But there 's no reason why we should n't share good news at the same time . 
Federal , state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much - needed funding sources for people who are truly in need . 
In spite of that , Pleasant Run Children 's Homes , with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care , continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help . 
We all hear about today 's increases in neglect , abuse and abandonment of those who ca n't fight back : children . 
Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade . 
The positive side . 
These are special children . 
They come into a Pleasant Run program ... whether it 's for therapeutic help in their own homes ( which nurtures whole families ) , through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes . 
For some , it 's a matter of weeks or months ; for others , it 's years . 
They leave Pleasant Run , generally , ready and able to contribute to society . 
We 're proud of our children and all that they overcome . 
We are a not-for-profit _ _ _ _ , multi-service _ _ agency . 
We would n't exist if the need were n't there . 
The numbers of children who deserve our services are rising ... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them . 
Please help us help them . 
Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ... " where good kids get better . " 
Dear , 
A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill 's help . 
Here 's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source : Goodwill 's controller , Juli . 
She tells me that the 3,366 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $ 49 million dollars . 
In addition to that , by helping them find jobs , Goodwill reduced the state 's Public Support tab by an estimated $ 4 million . 
Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work . 
What kind of work does Goodwill do ? 
Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities . 
After Maureen 's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant , we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society . 
Remember what she said in my last letter ? 
" If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... " 
Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance . 
Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family . 
At Goodwill she gained in self-confidence _ _ , in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job . 
" Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent . 
I am now ... totally off of welfare . " 
Goodwill prepares people for life - long employment . 
Cornell found a number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a work-site _ _ injury forced him out of his job at a foundry . 
He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new - found skills in a burgeoning industry . 
" I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career . " 
Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill . 
After a lifetime of trials , Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill , she earned a job here . 
" I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow . 
I wanted to be there ... I had my second chance to change my life . " 
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success . 
Your support will help them go to work . 
Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today ! 
Sincerely , William A Carter , Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation 
P.S. 
Your gift is a wise investment in the community . 
For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998 , we helped our " graduates " earn an estimated $ 102 . 
That money was then spent in a variety of ways , adding fuel to our thriving economy . 
Mr. Caring Philanthropy 01234 Giving Way Contribution , USA 56789 
Dear Mr. Philanthropy , 
" The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change will be made . 
Do not sit this one out . 
Do not play it safe . 
Understand the world and change it where it needs to be changed ... 
Make our society better . 
Make a world worthy of the children that your generation will bear . " 
-- Carl Sagan 
You can help make positive changes in the lives of at-risk _ _ youth in central Indiana . 
We often hear about economic poverty , but what some of these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty - they have often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future . 
With your help , we can change that . 
Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook . 
Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers , these young people are self - confident , believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential . 
A recent study by PublicPrivate Ventures ( PPV ) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year : reduced first - time drug use by 46 % lowered school absenteeism by 52 % cut violent behavior by 33 % enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships 
Former Little Sister Amy , now 18 - years old , is a testament to the Big Sisters program . 
" I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992 . 
Since then , she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things . 
We go to movies , dinner , concerts , and other stuff like that , but I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser type things . 
Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister , but I learned a lot from her too . 
I have become more open-minded _ _ , more responsible , and , most importantly , I have gained a lot more self-confidence _ _ . 
I am very thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special opportunity . 
In 1998 , Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs . 
But the need is still great . 
Over 170 young people are still waiting for a mentor . 
You are an important part in making sure these young people are matched with caring adult mentors . 
Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need , that more young people stay in school , stay off drugs and make good choices ? 
Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality volunteers . 
It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships , including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff . 
This year your gift can go farther ! 
Gifts of $ 100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th Anniversary $ 100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For Girls Fund . 
This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring relationships by the end of 1999 and 1,200 by the end of 2004 . 
If you would like to find out more about the Big Sisters program , please call us , ( 317 ) 634-6102 and ask for Ellen Robinson . 
Thank you very much for your time , attention and consideration . 
Sincerely , Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson 
P.S. 
When you give to Big Sisters , you can get 50 % back ! 
For a minimum contribution of $ 250 , you become eligible for a 50 % Indiana state tax credit through the Indiana Department of Commerce Neighborhood Assistance Program ( NAP ) . 
A limited number of credits are available .

Dear Mrs. Name , 
Confidence . 
An understanding that , above anything else , success requires genuine effort , a willingness to set challenging goals . 
Caring about others . 
These are the attributes we want all children to have . 
You help Jameson campers reach for them . 
If these special children are to become the adults we all need them to be , we have to lead them in the right direction right now . 
Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you 'll continue your support this year . 
Your last gift of $ 50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance , encouragement and fun to nearly 400 Indianapolis area children . 
And not just during the summer , but throughout the year . 
What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care ? 
The best indicator I can give you of the positive effect our year-round _ _ contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership teens . 
In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects . 
YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers . 
A five day camp , J.C. juniors introduces at-risk _ _ children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them . 
That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable , positive and important part of each child 's life for an entire decade . 
The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them . 
And their activities are n't isolated to Jameson . 
The teens have undertaken a volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local hospital . 
Please consider renewing your gift today . 
The kids need your leadership now more than ever . 
If you can increase your last donation , we would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives . 
Thank you again for helping point the way . 
Sincerely , Julie Marsh , Executive Director 
P.S. 
You make it possible for us to help special kids with learning disabilities , behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals . 
It 's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away . 
At Pleasant Run , Inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families . 
Every year we seek companies , organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families . 
These families are participants in our community - based programs . 
These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family . 
After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils , beds , cleaning supplies , etc . 
We meet these needs immediately . 
But , the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families . 
They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal . 
We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season . 
If you are interested and would like more information , please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222 . 
We would like to have families matched with sponsors no later than xxxx . 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need . 
Dear Friend : 
Adolescence . 
It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl - when small changes in her behavior , or the choices she makes , can affect her future . 
It 's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she 's surrounded by support . 
It 's even harder when she is n't . 
Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring , responsible adult volunteers with at-risk _ _ girls , ages 8 - 14 . 
A Big Sister is a mentor , a friend and a role model , helping a young girl to develop the self-confidence _ _ and life skills necessary to become a responsible , productive and successful adult . 
Your $ 1,000 contribution can put a mentor in a child 's life - and hope in a child 's future . 
The results of an 18 - month study completed by PublicPrivate Ventures showed that children participating in one - to - one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year , reduced first time drug use by 46 % ; lowered school absenteeism by 52 % ; cut aggressive behavior by 33 % ; enhanced school performance ; and improved relations with family and friends . 
This is positive proof that Big Sisters one - to - one mentoring program helps change lives . 
Today , we are offering you the opportunity to help change a life . 
By contributing $ 1,000 you can support one match for one year . 
This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships . 
This includes a volunteer screening process , orientation , training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff . 
As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of " your match " and be identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office , in the agency newsletter and annual report . 
Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana . 
But for each girl served , more are left unserved . 
Over 235 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister . 
Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match ! 
I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to your congregation .

Dear Name : 
In the summer of 1993 , the Marion County Commission on Youth began what can best be described as a " new era " in its history . 
MCCOY was reorganized as an independent , not-for-profit _ _ _ _ agency , separate from local government . 
It retained , however , the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception : to serve as a catalyst for effective , coordinated , and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community . 
For the past three years , MCCOY has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others : youth service providers , youth , funding bodies , and interested citizens to name a few . 
We have met with a number of successes along the way , most notably the Summer Fun Line , the Metro Summer Bus Pass , and the development of ten neighborhood youth councils . 
A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the years to come . 
The formation of The Community Academy , a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems , has come about as a result of MCCOY 's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue . 
McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making _ _ and program planning processes . 
One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne , Indiana . 
As a team , these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a " Caring Neighborhood with Youth " , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all . 
Since its re-organization _ _ , MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best : helping to identify youth needs , convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs , and moving toward collaborative solutions . 
McCoy has only one interest : the well being of Marion County 's young people . 
McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $ 10,000.00 to support such activities as : ---- the co-ordination _ _ of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood - based youth councils ; ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities ; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery ; ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth - adult relationships ; ---- the development of community - wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people . 
In the last several years , the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce . 
Youth who are supported and encouraged by both a family and a society that values Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and contributing members of adult society . 
While we have made significant inroads , there remains much to be done and it is clear that we can not do it alone . 
We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well . 
Your contribution will enable us to both continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a city famous for its commitment to youth and families . 
In our fund raising efforts to date , we have received the support of local government , foundations , and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members . 
We believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community as a whole .

Dear , 
Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt when you first left home ? 
The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have those same feelings . 
Very few have family support to get them started . 
Many need furniture , linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on their own . 
To help them establish themselves in the community , the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs . 
Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $ 500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements : 
1. Release by the courts 
2. Successful completion of all life skills tests 
3. Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program 
4. Possession of a high school diploma or GED 
Proof of meeting these , two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel , which determines if the applicant merits the funds . 
Such fund are often used for college tuition , vocational training or a deposit on an apartment . 
Because Pleasant Run is the only " family " for so many , our Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult . 
Without private donor support , this Fund does n't exist . 
Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future . 
Dear Name , 
What a Summer ! 
And we 're just getting started ! 
I hope you 'll consider continuing your support of Jameson 's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx . 
I can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before . 
All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity ( and , truth be told , with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in ) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open . 
Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social-workers _ _ and family counseling agencies . 
It seems summer options are n't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes , so we 're doing all we can to make Jameson available . 
That " we " includes the Youth Leadership teens . 
These 60 or so campers have taken on a fund raiser with a goal of raising $ 16,000 for camperships . 
Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves . 
And that 's from kids many people see as a problem . 
Even after the summer sessions come to a close , Jameson campers will take part in year-round _ _ programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important . 
We 've scheduled more than 15 follow-up _ _ camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summer 's camping season . 
Please , consider renewing your support of these great kids today . 
Sincerely , Julie Marsh Executive Director 
P.S. 
We know our follow-up _ _ weekends are going to be better attended than ever this fall and winter . 
If you can give a little more to help meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support .

The goal of MCCOY , Inc. has been to make a difference . 
In 1998 , MCCOY , Inc. led two efforts that , we believe , will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well . 
Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain : economic self-sufficiency _ _ , healthy family , social relationships , and involvement in the community . 
A short time later , the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well : caring adults , safe places to go , and positive things to do . 
One group of adults and one group of youth , through two very different processes , have arrived at the same conclusion ; our community still has much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into the responsible , productive adults who will our community in the future . 
As a provider of youth services , MCCOY , Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people . 
Recently , through a lot of hard work and alliances with organizations like yours , some steps have been taken in our community that will help young people continue to be involved in positive activities . 
One , IndyGo in April adopted a much - needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on their buses at half the normal fare all year long . 
Two , funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings . 
Through the youth mapping process , it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for youth on weekend evenings were lacking . 
That need is being met . 
As it has been an exciting year for all of us , MCCOY , Inc. can not do its part without the support of organizations like yours . 
Annually , we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis . 
Enclosed is a donation card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of us to live .
